2\. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Grayson Mill Acquisition

On September 27, 2024, Devon completed its acquisition of the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill for total consideration of approximately $5.0 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion of cash and approximately 37.3 million shares of Devon common stock, including purchase price adjustments. Devon funded the cash portion of the purchase price through cash on hand and debt financing. For additional information regarding the debt financing, see Note 13.

Purchase Price Allocation

This transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Grayson Mill and its subsidiaries have been recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition and added to Devon’s. The preliminary purchase price assessment remains an ongoing process and is subject to change for up to one year subsequent to the closing date of the acquisition. Determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Grayson Mill requires judgment and certain assumptions to be made, the most significant of these being related to the valuation of Grayson Mill’s oil and gas properties. The inputs and assumptions related to the oil and gas properties are categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Asset Exchange

On April 1, 2025, Devon and BPX Energy dissolved their partnership and divided their acreage in the Eagle Ford Blackhawk field located in Texas' DeWitt County. The transaction is expected to be accounted for as an equal, non-monetary exchange between the two parties.

Contingent Earnout Payments

Devon was entitled to contingent earnout payments associated with the sale of its Barnett Shale assets in 2020 with upside participation beginning at a $2.75 Henry Hub natural gas price or a $50 WTI oil price. The contingent payment period commenced on January 1, 2021, and had a term of four years. Devon received $20 million in contingent earnout payments related to this transaction in both the first quarter of 2025 and first quarter of 2024.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Objectives and Strategies

Devon enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL production to hedge future prices received. Additionally, Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL marketing activities. These commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps and costless price collars.

Devon does not intend to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and has elected not to designate any of its derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment.

Counterparty Credit Risk

By using derivative financial instruments, Devon is exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of counterparties whom Devon believes are acceptable credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative contracts only with investment-grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers. Additionally, Devon’s derivative contracts generally contain provisions that provide for collateral payments if Devon’s or its counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels. As of March 31, 2025, Devon neither held cash collateral of its counterparties nor posted cash collateral to its counterparties.

Credit Lines

Devon has a $3.0 billion revolving Senior Credit Facility, and, in the first quarter of 2025, Devon exercised its option to extend the Senior Credit Facility maturity date from March 24, 2029 to March 24, 2030. Devon has the option to extend the March 24, 2030 maturity date by an additional year subject to lender consent. As of March 31, 2025, Devon had no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility and had issued $4 million in outstanding letters of credit under this facility. The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon's ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, to be no greater than 65%. Under the terms of the credit agreement, total capitalization is adjusted to add back

non-cash financial write-downs such as impairments. As of March 31, 2025, Devon was in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 26.3%.

Term Loan Credit Agreement

In August 2024, Devon entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”), providing for delayed draw term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0 billion, including a 364-day tranche of $500 million and a two-year tranche of $1.5 billion. On September 27, 2024, Devon borrowed $1.0 billion on the two-year tranche (the “Term Loan”) to partially fund the closing of the Grayson Mill acquisition. In connection with the borrowing of the Term Loan, the undrawn commitments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement automatically terminated. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate based on term SOFR plus a spread adjustment that varies based on Devon's credit ratings. The interest rate on the Term Loan was 5.8% as of March 31, 2025.

The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains substantially the same financial covenant as the Senior Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2025, Devon was in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 26.3%.

Issuance of Senior Notes

In August 2024, Devon issued $1.25 billion of 5.20% senior notes due 2034 and $1.0 billion of 5.75% senior notes due 2054. Devon used the net proceeds to partially fund the Grayson Mill acquisition. For additional information, see Note 2.

Dividends

Devon pays a quarterly dividend which can be comprised of a fixed dividend and a variable dividend. The variable dividend is dependent on quarterly cash flows, among other factors. Devon has raised its fixed dividend multiple times over the past two calendar years and most recently raised it by 9% from $0.22 to $0.24 per share in the first quarter of 2025. The following table summarizes Devon’s dividends for the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in connection with its business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management to likely involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals. Actual amounts could differ materially from management’s estimates.

Royalty Matters

Numerous oil and natural gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayments. Devon is currently named as a defendant in a number of such lawsuits, including some lawsuits in which the plaintiffs seek to certify classes of similarly situated plaintiffs. Among the allegations typically asserted in these suits are claims that Devon used below-market prices, made improper deductions, paid royalty proceeds in an untimely manner without including required interest, used improper measurement techniques and entered into gas purchase and processing arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with oil, natural gas and NGLs produced and sold. Devon is also involved in governmental agency proceedings and royalty audits and is subject to related contracts and regulatory controls in the ordinary course of business, some that may lead to additional royalty claims. As of March 31, 2025, Devon has accrued approximately $40 million in other current liabilities pertaining to such royalty matters.

Environmental and Climate Change Matters

Devon’s business is subject to numerous federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, as well as remediation costs. Although Devon believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on its business, there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future.

The Company has previously received separate NOVs from the EPA alleging emissions and permitting violations relating to certain of our historic operations in North Dakota, western Texas and New Mexico, respectively. The Company has been engaging with the EPA to resolve each of these matters, and Devon is actively negotiating a draft consent decree with the EPA and the Department of Justice with respect to the North Dakota NOV matter. If finalized, the consent decree may include monetary sanctions and obligations to complete mitigation projects and implement specific injunctive relief. Given that negotiations of the draft consent decree are ongoing and the uncertainty as to the ultimate result of the North Dakota NOV matter, we are currently unable to provide an estimate of potential loss; however, the costs associated with the resolution of the North Dakota NOV matter or any of the other NOV matters could be significant in amount and may include monetary penalties.

Beginning in 2013, various parishes in Louisiana filed suit against numerous oil and gas companies, including Devon, alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused substantial environmental contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs’ claims against Devon relate primarily to the operations of several of Devon’s corporate predecessors. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. Although Devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, Devon denies the allegations in these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend against these claims.

The State of Delaware has filed legal proceedings against numerous oil and gas companies, including Devon, seeking relief to abate alleged impacts of climate change. These proceedings include far-reaching claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Although Devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, Devon denies the allegations asserted in this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend against these claims.

Other Indemnifications and Legacy Matters

Pursuant to various sale agreements relating to divested businesses and assets, Devon has indemnified various purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect to the businesses and assets acquired from Devon. Additionally, federal, state and other laws in areas of former operations may require previous operators (including corporate successors of previous operators) to perform or make payments in certain circumstances where the current operator may no longer be able to satisfy the applicable obligation. Such obligations may include plugging and abandoning wells, removing production facilities, undertaking other restorative actions or performing requirements under surface agreements in existence at the time of disposition. For example, a predecessor entity of a Devon subsidiary previously sold certain private, state and federal oil and gas leases covering properties in shallow waters off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of America. These assets are generally referred to as the East Bay Field. The current operator of the East Bay Field has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and will likely be unable to satisfy the eventual decommissioning obligations associated with the East Bay Field. Other companies in the chain of title of the East Bay Field have also sought bankruptcy protection and will also likely be unable to satisfy the eventual decommissioning obligations associated with the East Bay Field.

In March 2025, Devon received an order from the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to decommission assets located on certain federal leases in the East Bay Field (the “Federal Assets”). As a result, during the first quarter of 2025, Devon recorded a contingent liability of $125 million within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the estimated costs of decommissioning the Federal Assets. The Company expects to be able to access funds available under certain bonds and a cash security account as and when Devon performs and pays these decommissioning obligations. Devon believes the funds will likely cover approximately $100 million of the estimated decommissioning costs for the Federal Assets. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2025, Devon recorded an approximately $100 million receivable related to these sources of funds within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The remaining $25 million difference of the recorded decommissioning obligation and such sources of funds was recognized in other, net on the consolidated statement of comprehensive earnings. Devon may also be required to perform or fund decommissioning obligations associated with the East Bay Field under state and federal regulations applicable to predecessor operators beyond amounts accrued. Factors impacting this contingency include, among others: (i) the ultimate outcome of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, including with respect to state lease assets included in the East Bay Field, (ii) the actual costs to decommission the Federal Assets relative to the estimates, which are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and (iii) Devon's ability to successfully access funds under decommissioning bonds and other sources.

As of March 31, 2025, Devon has accrued approximately $200 million of contingent liabilities related to such decommissioning legacy matters, including liabilities associated with the East Bay Field.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values in the table above.

Level 1 Fair Value Measurements

Cash equivalents – Amounts consist primarily of money market investments and the fair value approximates the carrying value.

Level 2 Fair Value Measurements

Commodity derivatives – The fair value of commodity derivatives is estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward curves and data obtained from independent third parties for contracts with similar terms or data obtained from counterparties to the agreements.

Debt – Devon’s debt instruments do not consistently trade actively in an established market. The fair values of its debt are estimated based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity when active trading is not available. Our variable rate debt is non-public and consists of our Term Loan. The fair value of our variable rate debt approximates the carrying value as the underlying SOFR resets every month based on the prevailing market rate.

Level 3 Fair Value Measurements

Contingent Earnout Payments – Devon had the right to receive contingent consideration related to the Barnett asset divestiture based on future oil and gas prices. These values were derived using a Monte Carlo valuation model and qualify as a level 3 fair value measurement. For additional information, see Note 2.

Reportable Segments

Devon is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Devon’s oil and gas exploration and production activities are solely focused in the U.S. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its U.S. operating segments into one reporting segment due to the similar nature of these operations.

Devon’s chief operating decision maker is the executive committee, which includes the chief executive officer, chief operating officers and chief financial officer. To assess the performance of our assets, we use net earnings. We believe net earnings provides information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods.

The following table reflects Devon's net earnings, assets and capital expenditures for the time periods presented below.

The following discussion and analysis addresses material changes in our results of operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 compared to previous periods, and in our financial condition and liquidity since December 31, 2024. For information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Executive Overview

We are a leading independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company whose operations are focused onshore in the United States. Our operations are currently focused in four core areas: the Delaware Basin, Rockies, Eagle Ford and Anadarko. Our asset base is underpinned by premium acreage in the economic core of the Delaware Basin and our diverse, top-tier resource plays, providing a deep inventory of opportunities for years to come.

On September 27, 2024, we acquired the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill for total consideration of approximately $5.0 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion of cash and approximately 37.3 million shares of Devon common stock, including purchase price adjustments. The acquisition allows us to efficiently expand our oil production and operating scale, creating immediate and long-term, sustainable value to shareholders over time.

As evidenced by this acquisition, we remain focused on building economic value by executing on our strategic priorities of moderating production growth, emphasizing capital and operational efficiencies, optimizing reinvestment rates to maximize free cash flow, maintaining low leverage, delivering cash returns to our shareholders and pursuing operational excellence. Our recent performance highlights for these priorities include the following items for the first quarter of 2025:

•

Oil production totaled 388 MBbls/d, exceeding our plan by 1%. 

•

As of March 31, 2025, completed approximately 73% of our authorized $5.0 billion share repurchase program with approximately 77.5 million of our common shares purchased for approximately $3.6 billion, or $47.02 per share since inception of the plan. 

•

Exited with $4.2 billion of liquidity, including $1.2 billion of cash. 

•

Generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow and $6.8 billion for the past twelve trailing months. 

•

Paid dividends of $163 million and have declared approximately $154 million of dividends to be paid in the second quarter of 2025. 

•

Earnings attributable to Devon were $494 million, or $0.77 per diluted share.

•

Core earnings (Non-GAAP) were $779 million, or $1.21 per diluted share. 

Our net earnings and operating cash flow are highly dependent upon oil, gas and NGL prices which can be volatile due to several varying factors. During the first quarter of 2025, commodity prices have experienced heightened volatility and declines, driven primarily by economic uncertainty in global trade arising from geopolitical events and shifting trade policies, such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. and planned oil output increases by OPEC+. Despite the potential negative impacts of higher inflation rates and supply chain disruptions created by these developments, we remain committed to capital discipline and delivering the objectives that underpin our current plan. Our disciplined, returns-driven strategy is designed to adapt to market fluctuations by reducing activity when necessary to maximize free cash flow generation. We will continue to prioritize value creation through moderated capital investment and production growth, particularly with a view of the volatility in commodity prices, supply chain constraints and the economic uncertainty arising from inflation and geopolitical events. Our cash-return objectives remain focused on opportunistic share repurchases, funding our dividends, repaying debt at upcoming maturities and building cash balances.

To emphasize our commitment to maximizing free cash flow and creating value for shareholders, we recently announced a business optimization plan which is anticipated to improve our annual pre-tax cash flow by $1.0 billion. The plan includes actions to achieve more efficient field-level operations and improvements in drilling and completion costs while improving operating margins and corporate costs. These savings are on track to be achieved by the end of 2026 with approximately $400 million expected to be completed by the end of 2025.

From the fourth quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, the change in volumes contributed to a $165 million decrease in earnings. The decrease in volumes was primarily due to natural well declines in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford and Anadarko Basin, as well as winter weather impacts in the Delaware and Anadarko Basins.

From the fourth quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, realized prices contributed to a $205 million increase in earnings. Unhedged oil, gas and NGL prices increased primarily due to higher WTI, Henry Hub and Mont Belvieu index prices, respectively. The increase in unhedged prices was partially offset by unfavorable gas and NGL hedge cash settlements.

We currently have approximately 30% and 35% of our remaining anticipated 2025 oil and gas production hedged, respectively.

Production expenses increased primarily due to the timing of new well activity in the Delaware Basin and Rockies, which led to higher LOE in the first quarter of 2025.

Field-Level Cash Margin

The table below presents the field-level cash margin for each of our operating areas. Field-level cash margin is computed as oil, gas and NGL sales less production expenses and is not a measure defined by GAAP. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is found in “Non-GAAP Measures” in this Item 2. The changes in production volumes, realized prices and production expenses, shown above, had the following impact on our field-level cash margins by asset.

From the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, the change in volumes contributed to a $542 million increase in earnings. Volumes increased primarily due to the Grayson Mill acquisition in the Rockies, which closed in the third quarter of 2024 as well as new well activity across our portfolio, particularly in the Delaware Basin.

From the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, realized prices contributed to a $45 million decrease in earnings. This decrease was due to lower unhedged realized oil prices which decreased primarily due to lower WTI index prices. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in unhedged realized gas and NGL prices which were primarily due to higher Henry Hub and Mont Belvieu index prices. Realized prices were also negatively impacted by unfavorable gas and NGL hedge cash settlements.

Production expenses increased in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to increased activity in the Rockies related to the Grayson Mill acquisition as well as new well activity across the portfolio.

Field-Level Cash Margin

The table below presents the field-level cash margin for each of our operating areas. Field-level cash margin is computed as oil, gas and NGL sales less production expenses and is not a measure defined by GAAP. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is found in “Non-GAAP Measures” in this Item 2. The changes in production volumes, realized prices and production expenses, shown above, had the following impact on our field-level cash margins by asset.

DD&A increased in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to higher volumes driven by the Grayson Mill acquisition and new well activity across our portfolio.

In the first quarter of 2025, Devon rationalized two headquarters-related real estate assets resulting in total asset impairments of $254 million. As a result, our annual DD&A will be reduced by approximately $15 million and our net financing costs will be reduced by approximately $20 million due to the extinguishment of the associated financing lease. See Note 5 in "Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements" of this report for further discussion.

G&A increased in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to higher employee compensation, driven in part by inflationary adjustments and the Grayson Mill acquisition. However, our G&A per Boe rate decreased due to the Grayson Mill acquisition efficiently expanding our operating scale and production.

Operating Cash Flow

As presented in the table above, net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity. Operating cash flow funded our capital expenditures, and we continued to return value to our shareholders by utilizing cash flow and cash balances for share repurchases and dividends.

Capital Expenditures

The amounts in the table below reflect cash payments for capital expenditures, including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior periods.

Capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations, midstream operations and other corporate activities. Our capital investment program is driven by a disciplined allocation process focused on moderating our production growth and maximizing our returns. As such, our capital expenditures for the first three months of 2025 represented approximately 48% of our operating cash flow.

Noncontrolling Interest Activity, net

During the first three months of 2025 and 2024, we distributed $9 million and $7 million, respectively, to our noncontrolling interests in CDM. During the first three months of 2025 and 2024, we received $14 million and $12 million, respectively, in contributions from our noncontrolling interests.

Liquidity

The business of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive. Because oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are a depleting resource, we, like all upstream operators, must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production. Generally, our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production from existing wells. At opportunistic times, we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or landowners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets.

On September 27, 2024, Devon acquired the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill. This acquisition adds a high-margin production mix that enhances our position and efficiently expands our operating scale and production. The acquisition delivers sustainable accretion to earnings and free cash flow further supporting our cash-return business model, which moderates growth, emphasizes capital efficiencies and prioritizes cash returns to shareholders.

To emphasize our commitment to maximizing free cash flow and creating value for shareholders, we recently announced a business optimization plan which is anticipated to improve our annual pre-tax cash flow by $1.0 billion. These optimization initiatives

will be primarily focused on capital efficiencies, production optimization, commercial opportunities and corporate cost reductions. These savings are on track to be achieved by the end of 2026 with approximately $400 million expected to be completed by the end of 2025.

Historically, our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow, cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds. Additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line of credit, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. If needed, we can also issue debt and equity securities, including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. We estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements as discussed in this section as well as return cash to shareholders.

Operating Cash Flow

Key inputs into determining our planned capital investment are the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, we held approximately $1.2 billion of cash. Our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as actual results may differ from our expectations.

Commodity Prices – The most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil, gas and NGLs we produce and sell. Prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather, changes in public policy, including the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. or other countries, and other highly variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control.

To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk. The key terms to our oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments as of March 31, 2025 are presented in Note 3 in “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report.

Further, when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position, we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities. We remain committed to capital discipline and focused on delivering the objectives that underpin our capital plan for 2025. However, if commodity prices decline further, we will adapt our plan by reducing activity in order to maximize free cash flow.

Operating Expenses – Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. As a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. However, the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices.

Additionally, the economic uncertainty in global trade arising from geopolitical events and shifting trade policies, such as the imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may contribute to higher inflation rates and disrupt supply chains, negatively impacting our cash flow. While we actively work to mitigate the impact of these potential risks through operational efficiencies gained from the scale of our operations as well as by leveraging long-standing relationships with our suppliers, the ultimate impacts remain uncertain.

Credit Losses – Our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. This includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil, gas and NGL production, the collection of receivables from our joint interest owners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. We utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, joint interest owners and counterparties. Such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, requiring letters of credit, prepayments or cash collateral postings.

Credit Availability

As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Facility. This credit facility supports our $3.0 billion of short-term credit under our commercial paper program. At March 31, 2025, there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program, and we were in compliance with the Senior Credit Facility’s financial covenant.

Debt Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and the size and scale of our production. Our credit rating from Standard and Poor’s Financial Services is BBB with a stable outlook. Our credit rating from Fitch is BBB+ with a stable outlook. Our credit rating from Moody’s Investor Service is Baa2 with a stable outlook. Any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.

There are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. However, a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on our Term Loan or any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future.

Cash Returns to Shareholders

We are committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors when setting the quarterly dividend, if any, including a general target of paying out approximately 10% of operating cash flow through the fixed dividend. In addition to the fixed quarterly dividend, we may pay a variable dividend or complete share repurchases. The declaration and payment of any future dividend, whether fixed or variable, will remain at the full discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

In May 2025, Devon announced a cash dividend in the amount of $0.24 per share payable in the second quarter of 2025 and will total approximately $154 million.

Our Board of Directors has authorized a $5.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on June 30, 2026. Through April 2025, we had executed $3.7 billion of the authorized program.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures budget for the remainder of 2025 is expected to be approximately $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion.

Investment Divestiture

On May 5, 2025, Devon agreed to sell its investment in Matterhorn for approximately $375 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. Proceeds from the divestiture will be used to further strengthen our investment-grade financial position.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Purchase Accounting

Periodically, we acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations, such as the acquisition of the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill. In connection with the acquisition, we allocated the $5.0 billion of purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The preliminary purchase price assessment remains an ongoing process and is subject to change for up to one year subsequent to the closing date of the acquisition.

We made a number of assumptions in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties. Since sufficient market data was not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, we prepared estimates and engaged third-party valuation experts. Significant judgments and assumptions are inherent in these estimates and include, among other things, estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of future commodity prices, drilling plans, expected development costs, lease operating costs, reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflects the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates.

Table of Contents

Estimated fair values ascribed to assets acquired can have a significant impact on future results of operations presented in Devon’s financial statements. A higher fair value ascribed to a property results in higher DD&A expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserve quantities, development costs and operating costs. In the event that future commodity prices or reserve quantities are lower than those used as inputs to determine estimates of acquisition date fair values, the likelihood increases that certain costs may be determined to not be recoverable.

For additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Non-GAAP Measures

We utilize “core earnings attributable to Devon” and “core earnings per share attributable to Devon” that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Core earnings attributable to Devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain non-cash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results. Our non-GAAP measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. Amounts excluded relate to asset dispositions, non-cash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and restructuring and transaction costs.

We believe these non-GAAP measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts. We also believe these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers.

Below are reconciliations of core earnings and core earnings per share attributable to Devon to comparable GAAP measures.

EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin

To assess the performance of our assets, we use EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin. We compute EBITDAX as net earnings before income tax expense; financing costs, net; exploration expenses; DD&A; asset impairments; asset disposition gains and losses; non-cash share-based compensation; non-cash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments; restructuring and transaction costs; accretion on discounted liabilities; and other items not related to our normal operations. Field-Level Cash Margin is computed as oil, gas and NGL sales less production expenses. Production expenses consist of lease operating, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, as well as production and property taxes.

We exclude financing costs from EBITDAX to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. Exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from EBITDAX because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. DD&A and impairments are excluded from EBITDAX because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. We exclude share-based compensation, valuation changes,

39

Table of Contents

restructuring and transaction costs, accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from EBITDAX because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance.

We believe EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods. EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin as defined by Devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from operations.

Below are reconciliations of net earnings to EBITDAX and a further reconciliation to Field-Level Cash Margin.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Commodity Price Risk

As of March 31, 2025, we have commodity derivatives that pertain to a portion of our estimated production for the last nine months of 2025, as well as for 2026. The key terms to our open oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments are presented in Note 3 in “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” in this report.

The fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by the forward curves of the relevant price indices. At March 31, 2025, a 10% change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net positions by approximately $275 million.

Interest Rate Risk

At March 31, 2025, we had total debt of $8.9 billion. Of this debt, $7.9 billion was comprised of debentures and notes that have fixed interest rates which averaged 5.7%. We also have a $1.0 billion Term Loan which has a variable interest rate that is adjusted monthly. The interest rate on the Term Loan was 5.8% at March 31, 2025.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Devon, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of March 31, 2025 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
