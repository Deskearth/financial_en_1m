IDEXX LABORATORIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited)

  

  

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the requirements of Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01 for financial statements required to be filed as a part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to “IDEXX,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. We do not have any variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of our management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our financial position and results of operations. All such adjustments are of a recurring nature. The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2024, was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, (the “2024 Annual Report”).

  

The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments, and methodologies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenues and expenses.

  

NOTE 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  

Significant Accounting Policies

  

The significant accounting policies used in preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2025, are consistent with those discussed in “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements in our 2024 Annual Report, and as updated below.

  

New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted

  

We adopted ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” as of December 31, 2024. ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosures. The amendments require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within segment profit and loss. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

  

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”, to provide disaggregated disclosures of specific expense categories underlying all relevant income statement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. The disclosure requirements will be applied on a prospective basis, with the option to apply it retrospectively. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating ASU 2024-03 to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of income tax rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments are effective

for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating ASU 2023-09 to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations

  

We enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations where customers purchase a combination of IDEXX products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment. We determine the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments, we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized. We evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer arrangements.

* * *

  

We allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices, and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each obligation. We utilize the observable standalone selling price when available, which represents the price charged for the promised product or service when sold separately. When standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable, we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including, but not limited to, the cost plus a margin approach. We recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, as described in the revenue categories above. We do not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that are part of arrangements with an original expected duration of one year or less.

  

The following customer arrangements represent our most significant customer contracts that contain multiple performance obligations:

  

Customer Commitment Arrangements. We offer customers incentives upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services.

  

Free or Discounted Instruments and Systems. Many of our customer commitment arrangements, such as our IDEXX 360 program, provide customers with free or discounted instruments or systems upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. We allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer, which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer. Our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract asset within other current and long-term assets. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for products and services over the term of the arrangement. We have determined that these arrangements do not include a significant financing component. 

  

On December 31, 2024, our contract assets were $246.3 million, of which approximately $19.2 million was reclassified to accounts receivable when customers were billed for related products and services during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Furthermore, as a result of new placements under commitment arrangements, net of subsequent amounts reclassified to accounts receivable and allowances established for credit losses, our contract assets were $252.8 million as of March 31, 2025. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their arrangement to assess the realizability of our contract assets and review estimates of variable consideration. Impairments and revenue adjustments that relate to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods, including cumulative catch-up adjustments to revenue arising from contract modifications, during the three months ended March 31, 2025, were not material.

  

Up-Front Consideration Paid to Customers. We provide customers with incentives in the form of IDEXX Points upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products and services. If a customer breaches their agreement, they are required to refund all or a portion of the up-front consideration, or make other repayments, remedial actions, or both. Up-front incentives to customers in the form of IDEXX Points or, from time to time, cash, are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as consideration paid to customers within other current and long-term assets, which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer arrangement. If these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments, we allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases less up-front incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices, to identified performance obligations, and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance. To the extent invoiced instrument revenue exceeds recognized instrument revenue, we record deferred revenue as a contract liability, which is subsequently recognized upon the purchase of products and services over the term of the contract. We have determined these arrangements do not include a significant financing component.

  

On December 31, 2024, our capitalized consideration paid to customers was $196.6 million, of which approximately $16.5 million was recognized as a reduction of revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Furthermore, as a result of new payments to customers, net of subsequent recognition, our capitalized consideration paid to customers was $197.8 million as of March 31, 2025. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their arrangement to assess the realizability of our capitalized consideration paid to customers and review estimates of variable consideration. Impairments and revenue adjustments that relate to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods, including cumulative catch-up

* * *

  

adjustments to revenue arising from contract modifications, during the three months ended March 31, 2025, were not material.

  

Rebate Arrangements. Our rebate arrangements provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the arrangement. Rebate incentives are typically offered in multi-year arrangements that include customer commitments to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services, or, to a lesser extent, are sometimes offered without future purchase commitments. We account for the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the arrangement. Total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional. We allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations, including the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases, which is deferred and subsequently recognized upon the purchase of products and/or services.

  

On December 31, 2024, our deferred revenue related to rebate and up-front consideration arrangements was $30.0 million, of which approximately $2.8 million was recognized when customers purchased eligible products and services during the three ended March 31, 2025. Furthermore, as a result of new customer purchases under rebate and up-front consideration arrangements, net of subsequent recognition, our deferred revenue was $30.0 million as of March 31, 2025, of which approximately 23%, 28%, 22%, 14%, and 13% are expected to be recognized during the remainder of 2025, the full years 2026, 2027, 2028, and thereafter, respectively.

  

For our customer commitment arrangements, we estimate future revenues related to multi-year arrangements to be approximately $4.7 billion, of which approximately 21%, 25%, 21%, 17%, and 16% are expected to be recognized during the remainder of 2025, the full years 2026, 2027, 2028, and thereafter, respectively. These future revenues relate to performance obligations not yet satisfied, for which customers have committed to future purchases, net of the expected revenue reductions from consideration paid to customers and expected price adjustments, and as a result, are lower than stated contractual commitments by our customers.

  

Instrument Rental Arrangements. Revenues from instrument rental and reagent rental arrangements are recognized either as operating leases on a ratable basis over the term of the arrangement or as sales-type leases at the time of installation and customer acceptance. Customers typically pay for the right to use instruments under rental arrangements in equal monthly amounts over the term of the rental arrangement. For some arrangements, customers are provided with the right to purchase the instrument at the end of the lease term. Our reagent rental arrangements provide customers the right to use our instruments upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables. These types of arrangements include an embedded lease for the right to use our instrument, and we determine the amount of lease revenue allocated to the instrument based on relative standalone selling prices. Lease revenues are presented in product revenue on our consolidated income statement. Lease revenue was approximately $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, including both operating leases and sales-type leases.

  

Sales-type Reagent Rental Arrangements. Our reagent rental arrangements that effectively transfers control of instruments to our customers are classified as sales-type leases, and we recognize instrument revenue and cost in advance of billing the customer, at the time of installation and customer acceptance. Our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a lease receivable within other current and long-term assets, and is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for products and services over the term of the arrangement. On December 31, 2024, our lease receivable assets were $19.0 million, of which approximately $1.3 million was reclassified to accounts receivable when customers were billed for related products and services during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Furthermore, as a result of new placements under sales-type reagent rental arrangements, net of subsequent amounts reclassified to accounts receivable, and allowances established for credit losses, our lease receivable assets were $18.0 million as of March 31, 2025. The impacts of discounting and unearned income as of March 31, 2025, were not material. Profit and loss recognized at the commencement date and interest income during the three months ended March 31, 2025, were not material. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their arrangement to assess the realizability of our lease receivable assets. Impairments during the three months ended March 31, 2025, were not material.

Operating-type Reagent Rental Arrangements. Our reagent rental arrangements that do not effectively transfer control of instruments to our customers are classified as operating leases, and we recognize instrument revenue and costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. The cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we transferred instruments of $3.3 million, compared to $3.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, from inventory to property and equipment.

  

We estimate future revenue to be recognized related to our reagent rental arrangements of approximately $69.1 million, of which approximately 20%, 25%, 21%, 17%, and 17% are expected to be recognized during the remainder of 2025, and the full years 2026, 2027, 2028, and thereafter, respectively. These future revenues relate to performance obligations not yet satisfied for which customers have committed to future purchases, net of expected price adjustments, and as a result, may be lower than stated contractual commitments by our customers.

  

Deferred Extended Warranties and Post-Contract Support Revenue

  

On December 31, 2024, our deferred revenue related to extended warranties and post-contract support was $25.2 million, of which approximately $16.0 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Furthermore, as a result of new arrangements, our deferred revenue related to extended warranties and post-contract support was $25.8 million at March 31, 2025. We do not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that are part of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less, and do not adjust for the effect of the financing components when the period between customer payment and revenue recognition is one year or less. Deferred revenue related to extended warranties and post-contract support with an original duration of more than one year was $8.8 million at March 31, 2025, of which approximately 32%, 34%, 19%, 9%, and 6% are expected to be recognized during the remainder of 2025, and the full years 2026, 2027, 2028, and thereafter, respectively. We have determined these arrangements do not include a significant financing component.

  

Costs to Obtain a Contract

  

On December 31, 2024, our deferred commission costs, included within other current and long-term assets, were $22.0 million, of which approximately $1.8 million of commission expense was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Furthermore, as a result of commissions related to new extended warranties and SaaS subscriptions, net of subsequent recognition, our deferred commission costs were $22.8 million at March 31, 2025. Impairments of deferred commission costs during the three months ended March 31, 2025, were not material.

  

  

NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS, ASSET PURCHASES AND INVESTMENTS

  

We believe that our acquisitions of businesses and other assets enhance our existing businesses by either expanding our geographic range, customer base, or existing product and service lines. From time to time, we acquire businesses that we account for as either asset purchases or business combinations, and noncontrolling minority interests in business entities, which we recognize as equity investments.

  

Business Combinations

  

During the first quarter of 2024, we acquired the assets of a privately-owned software and data platform business based in the U.S. that extended our practice management system cloud-native workflow and delivers strategic data solutions to our customers and their clients, for approximately $81.1 million, including a contingent payment valued at $4.4 million at the time of purchase. The fair values and the lives of the assets and liabilities acquired are as follows: completed technology of $17.1 million, with a life of 6 years; customer relationship intangibles of $12.5 million, with a life of 10 years; a non-compete agreement of $4.7 million, with a life of 5 years; and a trademark of $0.7 million, with a life of 10 years. We also recognized goodwill of $45.8 million, which represents synergies with our software business, and $0.3 million of net tangible assets, including accounts receivable. Goodwill related to this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma information has not been presented for this acquisition because such information is not material to the financial statements. The results of operations have been included in our CAG segment since the acquisition date. The acquisition expenses were not significant.

NOTE 5. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

  

The fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the three months ended March 31, 2025, totaled $64.8 million, compared to $65.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for unvested share-based compensation awards outstanding as of March 31, 2025, was $108.3 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recognized share-based compensation expenses of $14.6 million, compared to $14.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

  

We determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards as of the date of grant. Differences in the expected stock price volatility, expected term, or risk-free interest rate may necessitate distinct valuation assumptions at each grant date. As such, we may use different assumptions for options granted throughout the year. Option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we have no intention to pay such a dividend at this time; therefore, we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards.

  

The weighted averages of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option award on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows:

NOTE 6. CREDIT LOSSES

  

We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our sales of products and services to our customers. We maintain allowances for credit losses for potentially uncollectible receivables. We base our estimates on a detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category. Additionally, our estimates are developed based on historical credit loss experience, estimates of recoveries, current economic conditions, and future expectations. 

  

We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. We monitor our ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty balances against contract terms and due dates. We may require collateralized asset support or a prepayment to mitigate credit risk. Our activities include timely account reconciliations, dispute resolution, and payment confirmations. We may employ collection agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables. Historically, we have experienced low credit loss rates on our accounts receivables, customer commitment programs and lease receivables. Additional allowances may be required if either the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate, or a strengthening U.S. dollar impacts the ability of foreign customers to make payments to us on their U.S. dollar-denominated purchases. 

  

Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers.

  

Accounts Receivable

  

The allowance for credit losses associated with accounts receivable was $12.7 million and $12.6 million as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. The amount of accounts receivable reflected on the balance sheet is net of this allowance. Based on an aging analysis, as of March 31, 2025, approximately 86% of our accounts receivable had not yet reached the invoice due date, and approximately 14% was considered past due. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 85% of our accounts receivable had not yet reached the invoice due date, and approximately 15% was considered past due.

Contract Assets and Lease Receivables

  

The allowance for credit losses associated with contract assets and lease receivables was $7.0 million and $6.8 million as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. The assets reflected on the balance sheet are net of these allowances.

NOTE 7. INVENTORIES 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The components of inventories were as follows:

NOTE 10. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 

  

Accounts Payable - Supplier Financing Program

  

We have an agreement with a third party to provide a supplier financing program, which facilitates participating suppliers’ ability to finance payment obligations from us with a designated third-party financial institution. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to finance one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The terms of payments are consistent with the terms of our trade payables. Activity related to the obligations is presented within operating activities on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The changes in our outstanding payment obligations under this arrangement, which are included in accounts payable on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, were as follows:

NOTE 11. DEBT

  

Credit Facility

  

At March 31, 2025, we had $319.5 million in outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $250.0 million is the Term Loan, and $69.5 million is under our revolving credit facility, with a weighted average effective interest rate on the total outstanding borrowings of 5.3%, excluding any impact of our interest rate swap. At December 31, 2024, we had $250.0 million outstanding under our Credit Facility, all of which was the $250.0 million Term Loan, with a full year weighted average effective interest rate of 6.2%, excluding any impact of our interest rate swap. At March 31, 2025, we had remaining borrowing availability of $928.6 million under our $1.25 billion Credit Facility. The funds available under the Credit Facility reflect a reduction due to the issuance of letters of credit, which were primarily issued in connection with our workers’ compensation insurance policy for $1.9 million.

  

The applicable interest rate for the Credit Facility is calculated at a per annum rate equal, at our option, to either (i) a prime rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, (ii) an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (iii) an adjusted daily simple SOFR rate, plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio. In March 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to manage the economic effect of $250.0 million of variable interest borrowings under our Credit Facility. Refer to “Note 19. Hedging Instruments” for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activity. 

  

The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements, and violations of laws and regulations. The sole financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, which is defined as the consolidated leverage ratio under the terms of the Credit Facility, not to exceed 3.5-to-1. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility.

NOTE 12. REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK

  

We primarily acquire shares of our common stock by repurchases in the open market. We also acquire shares that are surrendered by employees in payment for the statutory withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted stock units and the settlement of deferred stock units, otherwise referred to herein as employee surrenders. We issue shares of treasury stock upon the vesting of certain restricted stock units and upon the exercise of certain stock options. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases, which is included in the cost of treasury stock acquired in open market repurchases. The number of shares of treasury stock issued during the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, was not material.

  

The following is a summary of our open market common stock repurchases, reported on a trade date basis, and shares acquired through employee surrenders:

NOTE 13. INCOME TAXES 

  

Our effective income tax rate was 21.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to 20.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period during the prior year, was primarily due to lower tax benefits related to share-based compensation.

  

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to U.S. state taxes, partially offset by tax benefits from share-based compensation. 

  

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, during the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, was $15.6 million and $13.2 million, respectively.

NOTE 15. EARNINGS PER SHARE 

  

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to our stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and vested deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and assumed issuance of unvested restricted stock units and unvested deferred stock units using the treasury stock method unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The treasury stock method assumes that proceeds, including cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the total unrecognized compensation expense for unvested share-based compensation awards, would be used to purchase our common stock at the average market price during the period. Vested deferred stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share because the associated shares of our common stock are issuable for no cash consideration, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued is fixed, and issuance is not contingent. Refer to “Note 5. Share-Based Compensation” to the consolidated financial statements in our 2024 Annual Report for additional information regarding deferred stock units. 

  

The following is a reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share:

Certain awards and options to acquire shares have been excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. The following table presents information concerning those anti-dilutive awards and options:

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES 

  

Commitments

  

Refer to “Note 8. Lease Commitments” for more information regarding our lease commitments.

  

Contingencies

  

We are subject to claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty, and therefore our actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed our accruals. Except for the litigation matter described below, as of March 31, 2025, our accruals with respect to actual and threatened litigation were not material.

  

In 2018 a lawsuit was filed against us involving an alleged breach of contract for underpayment of royalty payments made from 2004 through 2017 under an expired patent license agreement. The plaintiff asserted a claim of approximately $50 million, inclusive of interest through June 30, 2020, alleging that the incorrect royalty provision was applied to certain licensed products and services throughout the agreement term and that royalties were also due on non-licensed diagnostic services that were provided concurrently with licensed services. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff in September 2020. The appellate court reversed the trial court’s decision regarding the royalty payments in August 2022. In June 2024, the state supreme court reversed the appellate court, reinstated the trial court decision regarding the royalty payments, and remanded the case to the appellate court to address the remaining issues, including issues related to applicable interest. On April 3, 2025, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s decision regarding all remaining issues. In light of the appellate court’s decision, on April 17, 2025, we paid the judgment in the amount of approximately $80 million, and the plaintiff executed a satisfaction and release of judgment, which was filed with the trial court, concluding this matter. This amount was fully accrued as of March 31, 2025, and is included in accrued liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

  

From time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any such litigation, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the litigation.

  

Guarantees

  

We enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases, those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of potential indemnification under these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.

  

When acquiring a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we do not have any material pre-acquisition liabilities recorded.

NOTE 17. SEGMENT REPORTING 

  

We operate primarily through three business segments, which are our reportable segments: Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), Water quality products (“Water”), and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”). CAG provides products and services for veterinarians and the biomedical research community, primarily related to diagnostics and information management. Water provides innovative testing solutions for the detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water. LPD provides diagnostic tests, services, and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve producer efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk. Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic business (“OPTI Medical”) with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. OPTI Medical develops, manufactures, and distributes human medical diagnostic products and services. 

  

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) in assessing performance. The CODM, our president and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of operating segments based on revenues and gross profit. Our CODM reviews budget and actual results of the operating segments and decides how to allocate resources to meet our strategic priorities, and also meets with operating segment leaders on a periodic basis to determine allocation of resources.

  

The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements. Intersegment revenues, which are not included in the tables below, were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes and are not included in the review performed by the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and allocation of resources. Certain corporate expenses are allocated to the segments, including depreciation and amortization. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses for all operating segments are reported within our Other operating segment, and are reconciled in the table below.

  

The following tables are a summary of reportable segment performance with our Other operating segment to reconcile to the total consolidated for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024:

NOTE 18. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

  

U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 

  

We have certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, and certain financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets but for which we disclose the fair value. The fair value disclosures of these assets and liabilities are based on a three-level hierarchy, which is defined as follows: 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Level 1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.                                                                                                                                                                                 
Level 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  
Level 3    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.                                                                                                                                                         

  

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, or transfers in or out of Level 3, of the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended March 31, 2025.

  

Our cross currency swap contracts are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and are classified as derivative instruments. We measure the fair value of our cross currency swap contracts using prevailing market conditions as of the close of business on each balance sheet date. The product of this calculation is then adjusted for counterparty risk.

  

Our foreign currency exchange contracts are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and are classified as derivative instruments. We measure the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts using an income approach, based on prevailing market forward exchange rates less the contract rate, multiplied by the notional amount. The product of this calculation is then adjusted for counterparty risk.

Our interest rate swap contract is measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and classified as a derivative instrument. We measure the fair value of our interest rate swap contract using current market interest rates for debt issues with similar remaining years to maturity, adjusted for applicable credit risk.

  

The amounts outstanding under our unsecured Credit Facility and Senior Notes (“long-term debt”) are measured at carrying value in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets though we disclose the fair value of these financial instruments. We determine the fair value of the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility and long-term debt using an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for debt issues with similar remaining years to maturity, adjusted for applicable credit risk. Our Credit Facility and long-term debt are valued using Level 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of our Credit Facility approximates its carrying value. The estimated fair value and carrying value of our long-term debt were $603.6 million and $620.9 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2025, and $594.3 million and $617.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.

  

  

The following tables set forth our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy:

NOTE 19. HEDGING INSTRUMENTS 

Disclosure within this note is presented to provide transparency about how and why we use derivative and non-derivative instruments (collectively “hedging instruments”), how the instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how the instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

  

We recognize all hedging instrument assets and liabilities at fair value at the balance sheet date. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded at fair value through earnings. To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, cash flow and net investment hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows or fair value on hedged transactions. If the hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in AOCI, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedging instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. We de-designate hedging instruments from hedge accounting when the likelihood of the hedged transaction occurring becomes less than probable. For de-designated instruments, the gain or loss from the time of de-designation through maturity of the instrument is recognized in earnings. Any gain or loss in AOCI at the time of de-designation is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Refer to “Note 14. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” for further information regarding the effect of hedging instruments on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024.

  

We enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions, which permit certain outstanding receivables and payables to be offset in the event of default. Our derivative contracts do not require either party to post cash collateral. We elect to present our derivative assets and liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. All cash flows related to our foreign currency exchange contracts are classified as operating cash flows, which is consistent with the cash flow treatment of the underlying items being hedged. 

  

We are exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations. We utilize hedging instruments to manage a portion of our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk.

  

Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, or foreign-denominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures, including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries.

  

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions, including transactions denominated in the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. We also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large well-capitalized multinational financial institutions, and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. 

  

Cash Flow Hedges 

  

We have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts and our interest rate swap as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments manage our exposure to variability in the cash flows of forecasted transactions attributable to foreign currency exchange and to interest rates on variable interest obligations under the terms of our Credit Facility. Unless noted otherwise, we have also designated our derivative instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment.

  

We did not de-designate any instruments from hedge accounting treatment during the three months ended March 31, 2025, or 2024. As of March 31, 2025, the estimated amount of gains, net of tax, from our foreign exchange contracts which are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI and into earnings within the next 12 months is $4.9 million if exchange rates do not fluctuate from the levels as of March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, the estimated amount of gains, net of tax, from our interest rate swap contract which are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI and into earnings through the end of the term, October 20, 2025, is $0.4 million if interest rates do not fluctuate from the levels as of March 31, 2025.

Interest Rate Swap: We entered into an interest rate swap contract to manage the effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of the Credit Facility. Beginning on March 31, 2023, the variable interest rate associated with $250.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at 3.9% plus the applicable credit spread, through October 20, 2025.

  

Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts: We target to hedge approximately 75% to 85% of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Australian dollar. We have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to intercompany foreign transactions and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge. We primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months. Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year. As a result, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year. The U.S. dollar is the currency purchased or sold in all of our foreign currency exchange contracts. The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales totaled $317.5 million and $325.7 million as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.

Net Investment Hedges, Euro-Denominated Notes

  

In June 2015, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of €88.9 million in euro-denominated 1.785% Series C Senior Notes due June 18, 2025. We have designated these euro-denominated notes as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result of this designation, gains and losses from the change in the translated U.S. dollar value of these euro-denominated notes are recorded in AOCI rather than earnings. We recorded losses of $3.0 million, net of tax, within AOCI as a result of this net investment hedge for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and gains of $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The related cumulative unrealized gain recorded as of March 31, 2025, will be reclassified to earnings when the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated or all or a portion of the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. Refer to “Note 13. Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2024 Annual Report for further information regarding the issuance of these euro-denominated notes.

  

Net Investment Hedges, Cross Currency Swaps

  

We have entered into cross currency swap contracts as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign operations to offset foreign currency translation gains and losses on the net investment. These cross currency swaps have maturity dates beginning on June 18, 2025, through June 29, 2029. 

  

At maturity of the cross currency swap contracts we will deliver the notional amount of €15 million and will receive approximately $17.5 million from the counterparties on June 18, 2025; we will deliver the notional amount of €35 million and will receive $37.8 million from the counterparties on March 31, 2028; we will deliver the notional amount of €90 million and will receive $98.2 million from the counterparties on June 30, 2028; and we will deliver the notional amount of €20 million and will receive $21.3 million from the counterparties on June 29, 2029. The changes in fair value of the cross currency swap

contracts are recorded in AOCI and will be reclassified to earnings when the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated or all or a portion of the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recorded losses of $3.6 million, net of tax, within AOCI as a result of these net investment hedges, and gains of $2.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024. We will receive quarterly interest payments from the counterparties based on a fixed interest rate until maturity of the cross currency swaps. This interest rate component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and is recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the hedge instrument. We recognized approximately $0.4 million related to the excluded component as a reduction of interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical fact, constitute “forward-looking statements.” Such forward-looking statements about our business and expectations within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), include statements relating to, among other things, our expectations regarding revenue recognition timing and amounts; business trends, earnings, and other measures of financial performance; projected impact of foreign currency exchange rates and hedging activities; realizability of assets; future cash flow and uses of cash; future repurchases of common stock; future levels of indebtedness and capital spending; the working capital and liquidity outlook; critical accounting estimates; deductibility of goodwill; inflation; and projected impacts of tariff and trade policy changes and uncertainty. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “expects,” “may,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “would,” “will,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “should,” “project,” and similar words and expressions. These forward-looking statements are intended to provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events; are based on current estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions; and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, the adverse impact, and the duration, of macroeconomic events, conditions, and uncertainties, such as geopolitical instability (including wars, terrorist attacks, and armed conflicts), general economic uncertainty, changes in U.S. and other countries’ tariff and trade policies, inflationary pressures, severe weather and other natural conditions, and supply chain challenges on our business, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, and stock price, as well as the other matters described under the headings “Business,” “Risk Factors,” “Legal Proceedings,” “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk” in our 2024 Annual Report and in the corresponding sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as those described from time to time in our other periodic reports filed with the SEC.

  

Any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of the day this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was filed with the SEC and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public, and they are subject to the risk and uncertainties described or cross-referenced in this section. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates or expectations change.

  

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our 2024 Annual Report that includes additional information about us, our results of operations, our financial position, and our cash flows, and with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

  

Our fiscal quarter ended on March 31. Unless otherwise stated, the analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations below, including references to growth and organic growth and increases and decreases, are being compared to the equivalent prior-year periods.

  

Business Overview 

We develop, manufacture, and distribute products and provide services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock, poultry and dairy, and water testing sectors. We also provide human medical point-of-care diagnostics. Our primary products and services are:

  

•Point-of-care veterinary diagnostic products, comprised of instruments, consumables, and rapid assay test kits;

•Veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services;

•Practice management and diagnostic imaging systems and services used by veterinarians;

•Health monitoring, biological materials testing, laboratory diagnostic instruments, and services used by the biomedical research community;

•Diagnostic and health-monitoring products for livestock, poultry, and dairy;

•Products that test water for certain microbiological contaminants; and

•Point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human medical diagnostics sector.

  

Description of Business Segments. We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information management-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary industry, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”); water quality products (“Water”); and diagnostic tests, services, and related instrumentation that are 

27

* * *

  

used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve producer efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk, which we refer to as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”). Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products business (“OPTI Medical”) with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. 

  

Currency, Tariff and Trade Policies, and Other Items

  

Currency Impact. Refer to “Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

  

Changes in Tariff and Trade Policies. Although we manufacture many of our companion animal and Water testing products, as well as certain of our LPD testing products, in the United States, we rely on third-party suppliers located in the United States and other regions (such as Europe and Asia-Pacific) for certain components, raw materials, and consumables used in or with our products. In addition, as a global business, our products and services are sold in more than 175 countries. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 35% of our overall revenues were attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the United States, with less than 1% of our overall revenues attributable to sales of products and services to customers domiciled in China. Accordingly, changes in tariff and trade policies may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

  

Recently, the U.S. government announced changes to its trade policy, including increasing tariffs on imports, in some cases significantly, and potentially renegotiating or terminating its existing trade agreements. For example, on April 2, 2025, the U.S. government announced a new universal baseline tariff of 10%, plus an additional country-specific tariff for select trading partners, on all U.S. imports. Although imposition of the country-specific tariffs was temporarily paused for most countries (not including China) on April 9, 2025, these actions, retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. exports and continuing uncertainty regarding tariff and trade policies have led to volatility and uncertainty in global markets. Continuing tariff and trade policy uncertainty may lead to sustained volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and global financial and economic conditions, increased inflation, diminished expectations for economic growth, and actual or perceived economic weakness, which could result in reduced demand for our products and services. 

  

While we are working to optimize operations and inventory management to the extent feasible, to help mitigate and reduce the potential impact from changes in tariff and trade policies, any imposed tariffs (including retaliatory tariffs) and our mitigation activities may cause our cost of goods to increase, our profit margins to decrease, or our products to become less competitive or less available in the applicable region. We are continuing to monitor the dynamic trade environment and evaluate these developments and our ability to offset some portion of these costs and otherwise mitigate the impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

  

Other Items. Refer to “Part I, Item 1. Business - Patents and Licenses” and “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2024 Annual Report for additional information regarding trends in companion animal healthcare, distributor purchasing and inventories, economic conditions, geopolitical conflict effects and patent expiration.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 

  

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The critical accounting policies and the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2025, are consistent with those discussed in our 2024 Annual Report in the section under the heading “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions.”

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  

For more information regarding the impact that recent accounting standards and amendments will have on our consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in “Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

  

Organic Revenue Growth. The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth, and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue,” “revenues,” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth.” Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain business acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, or as a superior measure to, revenue growth reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers.

  

We exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility, and can obscure underlying business trends. We calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current-year period and the comparable prior-year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior-year period. 

  

We also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size, and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period, and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction, and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends. We consider acquisitions to be a business when all three elements of inputs, processes, and outputs are present, consistent with ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations: (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business.” In a business combination, if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, we do not consider these assets to be a business. A typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition, which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business, such as employees or infrastructure. We believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth. The percentage change in revenue resulting from business acquisitions represents revenues during the current-year period, limited to the initial twelve months from the date of the acquisition, that are directly attributable to business acquisitions.

Segment Income from Operations. We report segment income from operations in our discussion of the results of the operations of our segments below. Segment income from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts for the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, income from operations. We exclude foreign currency transaction gains and losses for each reportable segment (CAG, Water, and LPD) from segment income from operations and report the full amount of foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our Other operating segment. We believe that reporting segment income from operations provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate each reportable segment’s business performance by excluding foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which are centrally managed by our corporate treasury function and which we do not consider relevant for assessing the results of each reportable segment’s operations. In addition, we believe that reporting segment income from operations provides information to investors regarding key metrics that are used by management, including our CODM, in evaluating the performance of each reportable segment.

Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures. We also use Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, net debt, gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures that should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, financial measures presented according to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility.

(1)Reported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to rounding.

  

Total Company Revenue. The increase in organic revenue reflects growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, including benefits from higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, higher volumes. Increased testing volumes were supported by new business gains, high customer retention rates, and our expanded menu of available tests, partially offset by constraints from macroeconomic and sector headwinds. The comparative impact on CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue from fewer equivalent business days in the quarter decreased overall revenue growth. Higher volumes and price gains in recurring veterinary software, services, and diagnostic imaging, also contributed to revenue growth. Higher revenue in our Water business was primarily due to the benefit of realized price increases and increased volumes. The increase in LPD revenue was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volume. The increase in Other revenue was primarily due to higher volumes of our OPTI Medical consumables and instruments. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue growth by 1.2%. Acquisitions increased revenue growth by 0.1%.

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased due to higher revenue and a 90 basis point increase in the gross profit margin. The increase in the gross profit margin increased primarily due to favorable business mix, benefiting from IDEXX VetLab consumable growth and instrument placement mix, as well as net price realization, offsetting inflationary cost impacts. The change in foreign currency exchange rates increased the gross profit margin by less than 10 basis points, including the impact of higher hedge gains during the current period compared to the prior period. 

  

Operating Expenses. Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related and travel costs. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related and information technology costs, offset by a reduction in accrued expense of approximately $9 million related to a litigation matter. Research and development expense increased primarily due to higher project costs, as well as higher personnel-related costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating expense growth by approximately 1%.

CAG Diagnostics Recurring Revenue. The increase in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue was primarily due to higher realized prices and also due to higher volumes in IDEXX VetLab consumables, offsetting lower volumes in Rapid Assay and constraints from macroeconomic and sector headwinds. The comparative impact of equivalent business days in the quarter decreased overall revenue growth. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth by 1.2%.

  

The increase in IDEXX VetLab consumables revenue was primarily due to higher price realization and volume increases, supported by 9% growth in our active installed base of instruments, compared to March 31, 2024, growth in testing by new and existing customers, our expanded menu of available tests, as well as high customer retention rates. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue growth by 1.7%.

  

The decrease in rapid assay revenue resulted primarily from lower volumes as a result of customers shifting pancreatic lipase testing to our Catalyst instrument platform, as well as lower clinical visits in the U.S., partially offset by higher price realization. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue growth by 0.7%.

  

The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due to higher global price realization and, to a lesser extent, higher testing volumes. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue growth by 0.8%.

  

The increase in CAG Diagnostics services and accessories revenue was primarily a result of growth in our active installed base of premium instruments. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue growth by 1.5%.

CAG Diagnostics Capital – Instrument Revenue. The decrease in instrument revenue was primarily due to lower ProCyte One and Catalyst placements, partially offset by higher placements of SediVue Dx and our recently-launched IDEXX inVue Dx Analyzer. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue growth by 1.5%.

  

Veterinary Software, Services and Diagnostic Imaging Systems Revenue. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher subscription and support services volume from our expanded installed base and higher realized prices. The increase in our systems and hardware revenue was primarily due to higher diagnostic imaging system sales. The change in foreign currency exchange rates was not significant to revenue growth. Acquisitions increased revenue growth by 1.8%.

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased due to higher revenue and a 110 basis point increase in the gross profit margin. The increase in the gross profit margin increased primarily due to favorable business mix, benefiting from IDEXX VetLab consumable growth and instrument placement mix, as well as net price realization, offsetting inflationary cost impacts. The change in foreign currency exchange rates on the gross profit margin was not significant.

  

Segment Operating Expenses. Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related, meeting and travel costs. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related and information technology costs, offset by a reduction in accrued expense of approximately $9 million related to a litigation matter. Research and development expense increased primarily due to higher project costs, as well as higher personnel-related costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating expense growth by less than 1%.

Revenue. The increase in revenue was due to higher realized prices and higher volumes. The increase in volumes was primarily from our Colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and E. coli testing. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue growth by 2.1%.

  

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased due to higher revenue. The overall change in foreign currency exchange rates increased the gross profit margin by approximately 40 basis points, including the impact of higher hedge gains during the current period compared to the prior period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the decrease in the gross profit margin was due to higher product costs, partially offset by higher realized prices. 

  

Segment Operating Expenses. Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs, as well as higher travel and meeting costs. General and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower personnel-related costs and lower bad debt expense. Research and development expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased in operating expense growth by approximately 2%.

Revenue. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes in the Americas, partially offset by lower volumes in Europe, in part due to the timing of distributor orders. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue growth by 2.8%. 

  

Gross Profit. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a 380 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin, partially offset by higher revenue. The decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily due to higher product costs, partially offset by higher realized prices. The change in foreign currency exchange rates increased the gross profit margin by approximately 100 basis points, including the impact of higher hedge gains during the current period compared to the prior period. 

  

Segment Operating Expenses. Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related and travel costs. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related and information technology costs. Research and development expense decreased primarily due to lower personnel-related costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating expense growth by approximately 2%.

Revenue. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher volumes of our OPTI Medical consumables and instruments and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices.

  

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased due to higher revenues and a 1,410 basis point increase in the gross profit margin. The increase in the gross profit margin was largely due to lower product costs and higher consumable volumes. The change in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the gross profit margin.

  

Segment Operating Expenses. Sales and marketing expense decreased due to lower travel costs. General and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower foreign currency transaction losses compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange gains and losses on settlements for all operating segments are reported within our Other segment. Research and development expense decreased due to lower personnel-related costs.

  

Non-Operating Items

  

Interest Expense and Income. Interest expense was $7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $7.9 million for the same period during the prior year. Interest income was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $4.4 million for the same period during the prior year. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to a decrease in money market investments, compared to the same period during the prior year.

  

Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 21.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to 20.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to lower tax benefits related to share-based compensation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  

We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, proceeds from long-term senior note financings, and amounts available under our Credit Facility. We generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our companion animal veterinary, livestock, poultry, dairy, and water products and services, consulting services, and other various systems and services. Our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees, inventory and supplies, repurchases of our common stock, taxes, research and development, capital expenditures, rents, occupancy-related charges, interest expense, and business acquisitions. Working capital totaled $181.4 million as of March 31, 2025, compared to $332.0 million as of December 31, 2024. The change in working capital is primarily due to higher cash balances and lower borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility in the prior year. As of March 31, 2025, we had $164.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $288.3 million as of December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, we had a remaining borrowing availability of $928.6 million under our $1.25 billion Credit Facility, with $319.5 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, we had $250.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under our Credit Facility is reduced by $1.9 million for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months. We believe that these resources, coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing, will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future. We may enter into new financing arrangements or refinance or retire existing debt in the future depending on market conditions. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations, for example, to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to raise capital in the U.S. through the incurrence of debt or equity issuances, which we may not be able to complete on favorable terms or at all. In addition, these alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings. 

  

We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash and cash equivalents are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S.

The cash and cash equivalents of $164.0 million held as of March 31, 2025, were held as bank deposits. As of December 31, 2024, of the $288.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held, $148.7 million was held as bank deposits and $139.6 million was held in a U.S. government money market fund. Our bank deposits are held at a diversified group of institutions, primarily systemically important banks. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2025, included approximately $1.0 million in cash denominated in non-U.S. currencies held in a country with currency control restrictions, which limit our ability to transfer funds outside of the country in which they are held without incurring costs.

(1) Days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter, the result of which is then multiplied by 91.25 days.

(2) Inventory turns are calculated as the ratio of our inventory-related cost of revenue for the quarter multiplied by four, divided by the average inventory balances at the beginning and end of each quarter.

The following table presents cash flow impacts from changes in operating assets and liabilities, excluding the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations:

Cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, decreased $20.7 million, compared to the same period during the prior year. The $11.1 million decrease in cash used for other assets and liabilities was primarily due to lower annual employee incentive program payments in the current period, compared to the same period in the prior year, and higher current period operating expenses that were prepaid in previous periods. The decrease in cash used by accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in the comparative growth in outstanding accounts receivable balances largely due to improved collection efficiency compared to the prior-year period, and to lower comparative changes in revenue between sequential quarterly periods. Cash provided by inventories increased due to higher increases in accrued payables during the current period compared to the same period in the prior year.

  

We have historically experienced proportionately lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionately higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned.

On April 17, 2025, we paid approximately $80 million, which was fully accrued as of March 31, 2025, to satisfy the judgment in a litigation matter related to an expired patent license agreement, concluding this matter. Refer to Note 16 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in “Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 

  

Investing Activities. Cash used by investing activities was $29.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $106.9 million for the same period during the prior year. The decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of a software business during the prior-year period.

  

Our total capital expenditure plan for 2025 is estimated to be approximately $160.0 million, which includes capital investments in manufacturing and operations facilities to support growth and efficiencies, as well as investments in customer-facing software development.

  

Financing Activities. Cash used by financing activities was $330.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $144.1 million used for the same period during the prior year. The increase in cash used was primarily due to $400.9 million of repurchases of our common stock during the current year, compared to $154.8 million of repurchases during the prior year. This increase in cash used by financing was partially offset by $69.5 million net borrowings under our Credit Facility during the current year, compared to no activity under our Credit Facility during the prior-year period.

  

We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders, and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing and deployment activities, as well as share price and prevailing interest rates, and are subject to market conditions. Refer to Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in “Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about our share repurchases.

  

As of March 31, 2025, we had $319.5 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The obligations under our Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency-related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness, and a change of control default. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements, and violations of laws and regulations. The sole financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test.

  

The aggregate principal amounts of our 2025 Series C Notes will become due and payable on June 18, 2025, and the aggregate principal amounts of our 2025 Series B Notes will become due and payable on December 11, 2025. We anticipate paying off our 2025 Series C Notes for €88.9 million when due in June 2025, and our 2025 Series B Notes for $75.0 million when due in December 2025, with available cash on hand, borrowings under our Credit Facility, or proceeds from the issuance of new notes, or a combination thereof. 

  

Should we elect to prepay any of our senior notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable Senior Note Agreements. Additionally, in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company, the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the Senior Note Agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes. The obligations under the senior notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable Senior Note Agreements, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency-related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under ERISA, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness, and a change of control default. The Senior Note Agreements contain affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of our subsidiaries, priority indebtedness, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements, and violations of laws and regulations. The sole financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test.

Effect of Currency Translation on Cash. The net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is related to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. These changes will fluctuate for each period presented as the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the value of foreign currencies changes. A currency’s value depends on many factors, including interest rates and the issuing governments’ debt levels and strength of economy.

  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities, except for letters of credit and third-party guarantees.

  

Financial Covenant. The sole financial covenant of our Credit Facility and Senior Note Agreements is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring transaction expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, share-based compensation expense, and certain other non-cash losses and charges (“Adjusted EBITDA”), as defined in the Senior Note Agreement and Credit Facility, not to exceed 3.5-to-1. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with such covenant. The following details our consolidated leverage ratio calculation:

Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, net debt, gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio are non-GAAP financial measures which should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, financial measures presented according to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, refer to the section under the heading “Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk” of our 2024 Annual Report. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the market risks described in our 2024 Annual Report, except for the impact of foreign exchange rates, as discussed below. 

  

Foreign Currency Exchange Impacts. Our foreign currency exchange impacts on operating results are comprised of three components: 1) local currency revenues and expenses; 2) the impact of hedge contracts; and 3) intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary.

  

Approximately 22% of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to approximately 21% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally, and a weakening of the U.S. dollar has the opposite effect. Similarly, to the extent that the U.S. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated costs and expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partially offsets this exposure. Additionally, our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues. 

  

The following table presents the estimated foreign currency exchange impact on our revenues, operating profit, and diluted earnings per share for the current period compared to the respective prior-year period:

At our current foreign exchange rate assumptions, we anticipate year-over-year changes for the remainder of the year will decrease our revenues by approximately $26 million, and reduce operating profit and diluted earnings per share by approximately $6 million and $0.06 per share, respectively. These unfavorable currency impacts to our operating profit and diluted earnings per share include net year-over-year impacts of foreign currency hedging activity, which is expected to increase our total operating profit by approximately $6 million and $0.06 per share for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2025. These estimates assume that the value of the U.S. dollar will reflect the euro at $1.08, the British pound at $1.25, the Canadian dollar at $0.69, and the Australian dollar at $0.59; and the Japanese yen at ¥148, the Chinese renminbi at RMB 7.35, and the Brazilian real at R$6.18 relative to the U.S. dollar for the remainder of 2025. The actual impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations.

Based on projected revenues and expenses for the remainder of 2025, excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies, we project a 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce revenue by approximately $11 million and operating income by approximately $4 million, net of hedge positions.

  

Interest Rate Risk. We entered into an interest rate swap to manage the effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of the Credit Facility. Beginning on March 31, 2023, the variable interest rate associated with $250.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at 3.9%, plus the applicable credit spread, through October 20, 2025. Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at March 31, 2025, were $319.5 million. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge. For more information regarding our interest rate swap, refer to “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 19. Hedging Instruments.”

  

Effects of Inflation. We expect to continue to face higher costs for labor, commodities, energy, and transportation, as well as increased prices from suppliers, due to inflationary pressures and changes in tariff and trade policies. We may not be able to offset these higher costs through productivity initiatives and price increases, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any price increases we may impose may lead to declines in sales volume or loss of business, if competitors do not similarly adjust their prices, or customers refuse to purchase at the higher prices.

  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended March 31, 2025, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

  

Due to the nature of our activities, we are at times subject to pending and threatened legal actions that arise out of the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based in part upon advice of legal counsel, the disposition of any such currently pending or threatened matters is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.

  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2024 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report. The risks described in our 2024 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results.

(1)As of December 31, 2024, our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to 78 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase program, which amount includes the approval of an additional 5 million shares on December 3, 2024. The initial program was approved and announced on August 13, 1999, and the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program has been increased by the Board of Directors on numerous occasions. There is no specified expiration date for this repurchase program and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There were no other repurchase programs outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2025, and no share repurchase programs expired during the period.

  

(2)During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we received 13,776 shares of our common stock that were surrendered by employees in payment for the minimum required withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted stock units. In the above table, these shares are included in columns (a) and (b), but excluded from columns (c) and (d). These shares do not reduce the number of shares that may yet be purchased under the share repurchase program.

  

(3)Includes the nondeductible 1% excise tax for shares repurchased in the open market.
