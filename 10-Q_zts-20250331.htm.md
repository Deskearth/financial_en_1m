ZOETIS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

1\. Organization 

Zoetis Inc. (including its subsidiaries, collectively, Zoetis, the company, we, us or our) is a global leader in the animal health industry, focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic products and services, biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health. We organize and operate our business in two geographic regions: the United States (U.S.) and International. 

We directly market our products in approximately 45 countries across North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and South America. Our products are sold in more than 100 countries, including developed and emerging markets. We have a diversified business, marketing products across eight core species: dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals) and cattle, poultry, swine, fish and sheep (collectively, livestock); and within seven major product categories: parasiticides, vaccines, dermatology, anti-infectives, pain and sedation, other pharmaceutical and animal health diagnostics. On October 31, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our medicated feed additive product portfolio, certain water soluble products and related assets, and, as a result, our major product categories no longer include the category of medicated feed additives. See Note 5. Divestitures.

2\. Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) can be condensed or omitted. Balance sheet amounts and operating results for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are as of and for the three months ended February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024. 

Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year. 

We are responsible for the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. The condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position and operating results. The information included in this interim report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In the third quarter of 2024, we concluded that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE) that was previously consolidated. The effects of the deconsolidation were not material to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

3\. Accounting Standards 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax disclosures. The new guidance requires standardized categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, disaggregation of income taxes paid and other income tax-related disclosures. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2025, which will result in additional disclosures in the notes to our annual consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The new guidance requires a public business entity to provide disaggregated disclosures, in the notes to the financial statements, of certain categories of expenses that are included in expense line items on the face of the income statement. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

4\. Revenue 

A. Revenue from Product Sales

We offer a diversified portfolio of products which allows us to capitalize on local and regional customer needs. Generally, our products are promoted to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists, and then sold directly by us or through distributors, retailers or e-commerce outlets. The depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of customers in different species and geographies. Many of our top-selling product lines are distributed across both of our operating segments, leveraging our research and development (R&D) operations and manufacturing and supply chain network.

Over the course of our history, we have focused on developing a diverse portfolio of animal health products, including medicines, vaccines and diagnostics, complemented by biodevices, genetic tests and a range of services. We refer to all different brands of a particular product, or its dosage forms for all species, as a product line. We have approximately 300 comprehensive product lines, including products for both companion animals and livestock, within each of our major product categories.

On October 31, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our medicated feed additive product portfolio, certain water soluble products and related assets, and, as a result, our major product categories no longer include the category of medicated feed additives. See Note 5. Divestitures.

Table of Contents

Our major product categories are:

•parasiticides: products that prevent or eliminate external and internal parasites such as fleas, ticks, lice and worms;

•vaccines: biological preparations that help prevent diseases of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts or induce a specific immune response;

•dermatology: products that relieve itch associated with allergic conditions and atopic dermatitis;

•anti-infectives: products that prevent, kill or slow the growth of bacteria, fungi or protozoa;

•pain and sedation: products that alleviate pain, primarily associated with osteoarthritis and postoperative pain;

•other pharmaceutical: antiemetic, reproductive and oncology products; and

•animal health diagnostics: testing and analysis of blood, urine and other animal samples and related products and services, including point-of-care diagnostic products, instruments and reagents, rapid immunoassay tests, reference laboratory kits and services and blood glucose monitors.

Our remaining revenue is derived from other non-pharmaceutical product categories, such as nutritionals, as well as products and services in biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health. 

Our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets; increase convenience and compliance for pet owners; and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses. Growth in the companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics sector is driven by economic development, related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care. Companion animals are also living longer, deepening the human-animal bond, receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicine, vaccines and diagnostics.

Our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to allow veterinarians and producers to care for their animals and to enable the cost-effective production of safe, high-quality animal protein. Human population growth and increasing standards of living are important long-term growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways. First, population growth and increasing standards of living drive demand for improved nutrition, particularly through increased consumption of animal protein. Second, population growth leads to greater natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity. Finally, as standards of living improve and the global food chain faces increased scrutiny, there is more focus on food quality, safety and reliability of supply. 

The following tables present our revenue disaggregated by geographic area, species and major product category:

5\. Divestitures 

On October 31, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our medicated feed additive product portfolio, certain water soluble products and related assets to Phibro Animal Health for an estimated net purchase price of $309 million, including $6 million of estimated post-closing adjustments subject to finalization.

6\. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Divestitures 

In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur restructuring charges associated with workforce reductions and site closings. In connection with our acquisition and divestiture activities, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions. Acquisition activity may also include integrating the acquired operations, which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, product transfers and restructuring the company, which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the company. Divestiture activity may also include costs to separate the divested operations, which may include expenditures for consulting and the disintegration of systems and processes, transfer costs, and restructuring charges which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the company's ongoing operations. All operating functions can be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as functions such as business technology, shared services and corporate operations. 

The components of costs incurred in connection with restructuring initiatives, acquisitions and divestitures are as follows:

8\. Income Taxes 

A. Taxes on Income

Our effective tax rate was 22.1% and 19.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to higher net discrete tax expenses, less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings (which includes the impact of the location of earnings and repatriation costs) and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. Jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary depending on repatriation decisions, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible items and non-taxable items.

In 2024, the company implemented an initiative to maximize its cash position in the U.S. This initiative resulted in a tax benefit in the U.S. in connection with a prepayment from a related foreign entity in Belgium which qualifies as foreign-derived intangible income; however, this income tax benefit was deferred to 2025 and 2026. A portion of this benefit was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2025.

B. Deferred Taxes

As of March 31, 2025, the total net deferred income tax asset of $369 million is included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets ($530 million) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($161 million). 

As of December 31, 2024, the total net deferred income tax asset of $373 million is included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets ($540 million) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($167 million).

C. Tax Contingencies

Uncertain Tax Positions

As of March 31, 2025, the net tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of $215 million (exclusive of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $41 million) are included in Other taxes payable. 

As of December 31, 2024, the net tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of $213 million (exclusive of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $38 million) are included in Other taxes payable.

Our tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations. Any settlements or statute of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. We do not expect that within the next twelve months any of our uncertain tax positions could significantly decrease as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of uncertain tax positions and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and any variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant. 

Status of Tax Audits and Potential Impact on Accrual for Uncertain Tax Positions

We are currently under income tax audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2017 and 2018. In July 2024, the IRS issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) related to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax incurred on the 2018 U.S. Federal Income Tax return. In September 2024, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) for the adjustments identified in the NOPA and a protest was filed with the IRS on November 15, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, the additional tax liability, based on the income adjustment proposed by the IRS under the RAR, is approximately $450 million, excluding interest and penalties.

Based on current facts and circumstances, we disagree with the IRS’ position and will defend our position taken on the 2018 U.S. Federal Income Tax return. We believe the amount previously accrued related to this uncertain tax position remains appropriate, but we will continue to evaluate the adequacy of our tax reserve as the audit progresses. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes and this amount could be material to our financial statements.

9\. Financial Instruments 

A. Debt

Credit Facilities

In December 2022, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multi-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility), which expires in December 2027. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to $1.5 billion. The credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for such period) of 3.50:1. Upon entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4.00:1, and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition. In addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants. 

We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. There were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of March 31, 2025 or December 31, 2024. 

We have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. As of March 31, 2025, we had access to $51 million of lines of credit which expire at various times and are generally renewed annually. There were no borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. 

Commercial Paper Program

In February 2013, we entered into a commercial paper program with a capacity of up to $1.0 billion. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, there was no commercial paper outstanding under this program. 

Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt

Our senior notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indentures (collectively, the indenture) between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. The indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions. The indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. In addition, the indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which the senior notes may be declared immediately due and payable.

Pursuant to the indenture, we are able to redeem the senior notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time by paying a “make whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade of the senior notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, we are, in certain circumstances, required to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.

The components of our long-term debt are as follows:

Interest Expense

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $54 million and $58 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 respectively. Capitalized interest expense was $11 million and $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively.

B. Derivative Financial Instruments

Foreign Exchange Risk

A significant portion of our revenue, earnings and net investment in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of various derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments serve to manage the exposure of our net investment in certain foreign operations to changes in foreign exchange rates and protect net income against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions. 

All derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and are reported as assets or liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The derivative financial instruments primarily offset exposures in the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro and Norwegian krone. Changes in fair value are reported in earnings or in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument, as follows: 

•For foreign currency forward-exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses that are used to offset the same foreign currency assets or liabilities immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts essentially take the opposite currency position of that reflected in the month-end balance sheet to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement. The vast majority of the foreign currency forward-exchange contracts mature within 60 days and all mature within three years.

•For foreign exchange derivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments against our net investment in foreign operations, changes in the fair value are recorded as a component of cumulative translation adjustment within Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings when the foreign investment is sold or substantially liquidated. These instruments include cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. Gains and losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings (Interest expense, net of capitalized interest). The cash flows from these contracts are reflected within the investing section of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These contracts have varying maturities of up to three years.

Interest Rate Risk

The company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rates and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. 

•In anticipation of issuing fixed-rate debt, we may use forward-starting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact expected future issuances of debt. Unrealized gains or losses on the forward-starting interest rate swaps are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are recognized in earnings over the life of the future fixed rate notes. When the company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that an anticipated transaction will occur within the originally expected period of execution, or within an additional two-month period thereafter, changes to fair value accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings.

•During the period from 2019 to 2022, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $650 million. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges against interest rate exposure related principally to the issuance of fixed-rate debt to refinance our 3.250% 2013 senior notes due 2023. Upon issuance of our 2022 senior notes, we terminated these contracts and received $114 million in cash from the counterparties for settlement. The settlement amount, which represented the fair value of the contracts at the time of termination, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, and will be amortized into income (offset to Interest expense, net of capitalized interest) over the life of the 5.600% 2022 senior notes due 2032. 

•As of March 31, 2025, we had outstanding forward-starting interest rate swaps, having an effective date and mandatory termination date in March 2026, to hedge against interest rate exposure related principally to the anticipated future issuance of fixed-rate debt to be used primarily to refinance our 4.500% 2015 senior notes due 2025.

•We may use fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges to hedge against changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in the benchmark of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). These derivative instruments effectively convert a portion of the company’s long-term debt from fixed-rate to floating-rate debt based on the daily SOFR rate plus a spread. Gains or losses on the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps due to changes in SOFR are recorded in Interest expense, net of capitalized interest. Changes in the fair value of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt. As of March 31, 2025, we had outstanding fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that correspond to a portion of the 3.900% 2018 senior notes due 2028 and the 2.000% 2020 senior notes due 2030. The amounts recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2025 for changes in the fair value of these hedges are not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

The company’s derivative transactions are subject to master netting agreements that mitigate credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. The company also has collateral security agreements with certain of its counterparties. Under these collateral security agreements each party is required to post cash collateral when the net fair value of derivative instruments covered by the collateral agreement exceeds contractually established thresholds. At March 31, 2025, there was $23 million of collateral received and $26 million of collateral posted related to derivative instruments recorded in Other current liabilities and Other current assets, respectively. At December 31, 2024, there was $51 million of collateral received and $20 million of collateral posted related to derivative instruments recorded in Other current liabilities and Other current assets, respectively.

We use a market approach in valuing financial instruments on a recurring basis. Our derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs in the calculation of fair value.

The amounts of net losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, recorded in Other (income)/deductions—net, are as follows:

(a) For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we capitalized less than $1 million of share-based compensation expense to inventory.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company granted 313,915 stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $156.64 per stock option and a weighted-average fair value of $40.21 per stock option. The fair-value based method for valuing each Zoetis stock option grant on the grant date uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which incorporates a number of valuation assumptions. The weighted-average fair value was estimated based on the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 4.39%; expected dividend yield of 1.27%; expected stock price volatility of 26.43%; and expected term of 4.3 years. Stock options granted prior to 2023 generally vest after three years of continuous service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of 10 years. Beginning in 2023, stock options granted are subject to graded vesting over three years from the date of grant and have a contractual term of 10 years. The values determined through this fair-value based method generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses, or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company granted 549,712 RSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $156.67 per RSU. RSUs are accounted for using a fair-value-based method that utilizes the closing price of Zoetis common stock on the date of grant. RSUs granted prior to 2023 generally vest after three years of continuous service from the date of grant. Beginning in 2023, RSUs granted are subject to graded vesting over three years from the date of grant. The values generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses, or Research and development expenses, as appropriate. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company granted 148,130 PSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $171.21 per PSU. Beginning in 2025, the units underlying the PSUs will be earned and vested over a three-year performance period in two tranches, each subject to an independent achievement condition: (1) a market condition comprising the total shareholder return of the company in comparison to the total shareholder return of the companies comprising the S&P 500 Health Care index at the start of the performance period, excluding companies that during the performance period are acquired or no longer publicly traded (Relative TSR); and (2) a performance condition comprising a three-year average annual operational revenue growth metric (average PSU operational revenue growth). PSUs that are earned and vested based upon a market condition are accounted for at fair-value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and PSUs that are earned and vested based upon a performance condition are accounted for at fair-value using the closing price of Zoetis common stock on the date of grant. The Monte Carlo weighted-average fair value was estimated based on volatility assumptions of Zoetis common stock and an average of the S&P 500 Health Care index companies, which were 27.6% and 29.8%, respectively. Depending on the company’s Relative TSR performance and the average PSU operational revenue growth at the end of the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 200% of the target number of units. Vested units are settled in shares of the company’s common stock. PSU values are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses, or Research and development expenses, as appropriate. PSU amortization for units that are earned and vested based upon the average PSU operational revenue growth is adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance-related condition.

13\. Stockholders’ Equity 

Zoetis is authorized to issue 6 billion shares of common stock and 1 billion shares of preferred stock. 

In August 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a multi-year share repurchase program of up to $6 billion of our outstanding common stock. As of March 31, 2025, there was $5.2 billion remaining under this authorization. Purchases of Zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs.

15\. Commitments and Contingencies

We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 8. Income Taxes.

A. Legal Proceedings

Our non-tax contingencies include, among others, the following: 

• Product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include injury, consumer, off-label promotion, antitrust and breach of contract claims. 

• Commercial and other matters, which can include product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings. 

• Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents or those of third parties on various products or processes. 

• Government investigations, which can involve regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other countries. 

Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial. 

We believe that we have strong defenses in these types of matters, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.

We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. 

Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions.

The principal matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is significant for financial reporting and disclosure purposes, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors in order to assess materiality, such as, among other things, the amount of damages and the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding, if such damages and other relief are specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be a class action and our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information about the company that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent.

Ulianopolis, Brazil

In February 2012, the Municipality of Ulianopolis (State of Para, Brazil) filed a complaint against Fort Dodge Saúde Animal Ltda. (FDSAL), a Zoetis entity, and five other large companies alleging that waste sent to a local waste incineration facility for destruction, but that was not ultimately destroyed as the facility lost its operating permit, caused environmental impacts requiring cleanup.

Table of Contents

The Municipality is seeking recovery of cleanup costs purportedly related to FDSAL’s share of all waste accumulated at the incineration facility awaiting destruction, and compensatory damages to be allocated among the six defendants. We believe we have strong arguments against the claim, including defense strategies against any claim of joint and several liability. 

At the request of the Municipal prosecutor, in April 2012, the lawsuit was suspended for one year. Since that time, the prosecutor has initiated investigations into the Municipality's actions in the matter as well as the efforts undertaken by the six defendants to remove and dispose of their individual waste from the incineration facility. On October 3, 2014, the Municipal prosecutor announced that the investigation remained ongoing and outlined the terms of a proposed Term of Reference (a document that establishes the minimum elements to be addressed in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Assessment), under which the companies would be liable to withdraw the waste and remediate the area. 

On March 5, 2015, we presented our response to the prosecutor’s proposed Term of Reference, arguing that the proposed terms were overly general in nature and expressing our interest in discussing alternatives to address the matter. The prosecutor agreed to consider our request to engage a technical consultant to conduct an environmental diagnostic of the contaminated area. On May 29, 2015, we, in conjunction with the other defendant companies, submitted a draft cooperation agreement to the prosecutor, which outlined the proposed terms and conditions for the engagement of a technical consultant to conduct the environmental diagnostic. On August 19, 2016, the parties and the prosecutor agreed to engage the services of a third-party consultant to conduct a limited environmental assessment of the site. The site assessment was conducted during June 2017, and a written report summarizing the results of the assessment was provided to the parties and the prosecutor in November 2017. The report noted that waste is still present on the site and that further (Phase II) environmental assessments are needed before a plan to manage that remaining waste can be prepared. On April 1, 2019, the defendants met with the Prosecutor to discuss the conclusions set forth in the written report. Following that discussion, on April 10, 2019, the Prosecutor issued a procedural order requesting that the defendants prepare and submit a technical proposal outlining the steps needed to conduct the additional Phase II environmental assessments. The defendants presented the technical proposal to the Prosecutor on October 21, 2019. On March 3, 2020, the Prosecutor notified the defendants that he submitted the proposal to the Ministry of the Environment for its review and consideration by the Prosecutor. On July 15, 2020, the Prosecutor recommended certain amendments to the proposal for the Phase II testing. On September 28, 2020, the parties and the Prosecutor agreed to the final terms and conditions concerning the cooperation agreement with respect to the Phase II testing. Phase II testing began the week of October 14, 2024. To date, the work has yet to be competed. We expect a report to be issued by the consultant upon conclusion of the testing.

B. Guarantees and Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or related to activities prior to the transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of March 31, 2025, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications were not material.

16\. Segment Information 

Operating Segments

We manage our operations through two geographic regions. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio, including parasiticides, vaccines, dermatology, anti-infectives, pain and sedation, other pharmaceutical and animal health diagnostics for both companion animal and livestock customers. 

On October 31, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our medicated feed additive product portfolio, certain water soluble products and related assets, and, as a result, our major product categories no longer include the category of medicated feed additives. See Note 5. Divestitures.

Our operating segments are the U.S. and International. The chief operating decision maker (CODM), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, uses the information provided to compare segment performance with segment resource requests and allocates human and capital resources based on segment’s actual results and expected future results.

Other Costs and Business Activities 

Certain costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the following: 

• Other business activities, includes our Client Supply Services contract manufacturing results, our human health business, and expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine research and development organization, research alliances, U.S. regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products. Other R&D-related costs associated with non-U.S. market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international commercial segment. 

• Corporate, includes enabling functions such as information technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, certain diagnostic costs and communications, among others. These costs also include certain compensation costs, certain procurement costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense. 

•Certain transactions and events such as (i) Purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; (ii) Acquisition and divestiture-related costs, where we incur costs associated with acquiring and integrating newly acquired businesses, such as transaction costs and integration costs, as well as divestiture-related costs; and (iii) Certain significant items, which comprise substantive, unusual items that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges and implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives that are not associated with an acquisition or divestiture, certain asset impairment charges, certain legal and commercial settlements and the impact of divestiture-related gains and losses. 

•Other unallocated includes (i) certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments; (ii) certain costs associated with finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations; (iii) certain supply chain and global logistics costs; and (iv) certain procurement costs.

Segment Assets 

We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment. Therefore, our CODM does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview of our business 

Zoetis is a global leader in the animal health industry, focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic products and services, biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health. For over 70 years, we have been innovating ways to predict, prevent, detect, and treat animal illness, and continue to stand by those raising and caring for animals worldwide - from veterinarians and pet owners to livestock producers. 

We manage our operations through two geographic operating segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animal and livestock customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 16. Segment Information. 

We directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate. Through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets, such as Brazil, Chile, China and Mexico, we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines businesses as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. 

Our companion animal and livestock products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian. On a more limited basis, in certain markets, we sell certain products through retail and e-commerce outlets. We also market our products by advertising to veterinarians, pet owners and livestock producers.

We believe our investments in one of the industry’s largest sales organizations, including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists, our high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply, and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs, has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers. Our research and development (R&D) efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so that they remain relevant for our customers.

We have approximately 300 product lines that we sell in over 100 countries for the prediction, prevention, detection and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect various companion animal and livestock species. The diversity of our product portfolio and our global operations provides stability to our overall business. 

A summary of our 2025 performance compared with the comparable 2024 periods follows:

Our operating environment 

For a description of our operating environment, including factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results, see "Our Operating Environment" in the MD&A of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Set forth below are updates to certain of the factors disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Quarterly Variability of Financial Results 

Our quarterly financial results are subject to variability related to a number of factors including, but not limited to: tariffs and other trade protection measures, the decline in global macroeconomic conditions, competitive dynamics, geopolitical tensions with and economic uncertainty in China, inflation, global supply chain disruption, variability in distributor inventory stocking levels as a result of expected demand and promotional activities, weather patterns, herd management decisions, regulatory actions, disease outbreaks, product and geographic mix, timing of price increases and timing of investment decisions. 

Tariffs and Trade Protection Measures

Our business is subject to risks related to, among other factors, tariffs and other trade protection measures put in the place by the United States or other countries, as well as U.S. international trade relations, including those with China, Canada and the European Union. Starting in early 2025, the United States government announced additional tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S. from numerous countries and multiple nations countered with reciprocal tariffs and other actions in response. While the final tariffs and other measures to be imposed, and their applicability to our business, remain uncertain, such actions may negatively impact demand and result in an increase in some product costs. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and evaluate actions that can be taken to moderate and/or minimize its effects. For further information regarding the impact of potential additional tariffs and trade protection measures on the Company, see Part II., Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Disease Outbreaks 

Sales of our livestock products have in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals. Outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious

Table of Contents

disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Alternatively, sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase.

Foreign Exchange Rates 

Significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Our products are sold in more than 100 countries and, as a result, our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, approximately 42% of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro and other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenue, cost of goods and expenses, and consequently, net income. Exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations. These fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, approximately 58% of our total revenue was in U.S. dollars. Our year-over-year total revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 4% from changes in foreign currency values relative to the U.S. dollar. For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.

Non-GAAP financial measures

We report information in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management also measures performance using non-GAAP financial measures that may exclude certain amounts from the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors and may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. We present certain identified non-GAAP measures solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance. 

Operational Results

We believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings results, but also “operational” results. Operational results is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as revenue or earnings results excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This measure provide information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a period-to-period comparison. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors, but should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported results. 

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share

Adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures of performance used by management. We believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures. We report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations, and the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of our products, prior to considering certain income statement elements. We define adjusted net income and adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Zoetis and EPS before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and divestiture-related costs and certain significant items. 

We recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, divestiture or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. The adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported EPS. See the Adjusted Net Income section below for more information.

Revenue

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. three months ended March 31, 2024

Total revenue increased by $30 million, or 1%, in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $103 million, or 5%, on an operational basis. Operational revenue growth was primarily due to the following:

•price growth of approximately 4%;

•volume growth from key franchises of approximately 4%; and

•volume growth from other in-line products of approximately 1%,

partially offset by

•volume decrease related to the impact of the divestiture of our medicated feed additive product portfolio, certain water soluble products and related assets (MFA divestiture) of approximately 4%; 

Foreign exchange decreased reported revenue growth by approximately 4%.

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased by $4 million, or 7%, in the three months ended March 31, 2025 versus the comparable prior year period primarily as a result of higher capitalized interest in the current period associated with capital projects to support our future growth.

The change in Other (income)/deductions—net in the three months ended March 31, 2025 versus the comparable prior year period was primarily as a result of lower foreign currency losses in the current period, partially offset by lower interest income in the current period.

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. three months ended March 31, 2024

Our effective tax rate was 22.1% and 19.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to higher net discrete tax expenses, less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings (which includes the impact of the location of earnings and repatriation costs) and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. Jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary depending on repatriation decisions, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible items and non-taxable items.

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. three months ended March 31, 2024

U.S. operating segment

U.S. segment revenue increased by $20 million, or 2%, in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of $75 million in companion animal products, partially offset by a $55 million reduction in livestock products. 

•Companion animal revenue growth was primarily due to increased sales of Simparica Trio®, small animal diagnostics, key dermatology products and our mAb products for OA pain, Librela® and Solensia®, partially offset by lower sales of our small animal vaccines.

•Livestock revenue declined primarily due to the impact of the MFA divestiture across cattle, poultry and swine products.

U.S. segment earnings increased by $23 million, or 3%, in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to higher revenue and lower cost of sales, partially offset by higher operating expenses, as well as the impact of the MFA divestiture.

International operating segment

International segment revenue was relatively flat in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024. Operational revenue increased by $73 million, or 7%, driven by growth of $56 million in companion animal products and $17 million in livestock products. 

•Companion animal operational revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of our Simparica® franchise products, key dermatology products and our mAb products for OA pain, Librela and Solensia.

•Livestock operational revenue growth was due to increased sales in our cattle and fish products, partially offset by lower sales of poultry products. Excluding the impact of the MFA divestiture, sales of cattle products grew largely due to price and sales of poultry products grew due to demand generation efforts in key poultry markets and price. Sales of our fish products grew due to increased vaccine sales in Norway. 

•Additionally, International segment revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange which decreased revenue by $72 million, or 7%, primarily driven by the Brazilian real, euro, Mexican peso, Argentinian peso and Turkish lira.

International segment earnings increased by $16 million, or 3%, in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024. Operational earnings growth was $35 million, or 7%, primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher cost of sales and operating expenses, as well as the impact of the MFA divestiture.

Other business activities 

Other business activities includes our Client Supply Services contract manufacturing results, our human health business and expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine research and development organization, research alliances, U.S. regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products. Other R&D-related costs associated with non-U.S. market and regulatory activities are generally included in the International segment.

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. three months ended March 31, 2024

Other business activities net loss decreased by $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflecting a decrease in R&D costs primarily due to timing of spend related to projects and other strategic investments, partially offset by an increase in certain compensation-related costs and depreciation expense.

Reconciling items

Reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results, such as costs associated with the following:

•Corporate, which includes certain costs associated with information technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, certain diagnostic costs and communications, among others. These costs also include certain compensation costs, certain procurement costs, and other miscellaneous operating expenses that are not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense; 

•Certain transactions and events such as Purchase accounting adjustments, Acquisition and divestiture-related costs and Certain significant items, which are defined below; and

•Other unallocated, which includes (i) certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments; (ii) certain costs associated with finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations; (iii) certain supply chain and global logistics costs; and (iv) certain procurement costs.

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. three months ended March 31, 2024

Corporate expenses decreased by $17 million, or 6%, in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange and lower compensation-related costs, partially offset by increased investments in information technology.

Other unallocated expenses increased by $1 million, or 1%, in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to higher manufacturing costs and higher inventory obsolescence, scrap and other charges, partially offset by lower freight charges and favorable foreign exchange.

Adjusted net income 

General description of adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure) 

Adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. The adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us. Additionally, we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized: 

•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted net income basis; 

•our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted net income basis; and 

•other goal setting and performance measurements.

Purchase accounting adjustments

Adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts, primarily associated with certain acquisitions, include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increase/decrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets. Therefore, the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges. 

While certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs previously have been expensed. 

A completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income. These components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above. We have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R&D costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. In addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. As such, in

total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets. 

Acquisition and divestiture-related costs

Adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration and disintegration costs associated with significant business combinations, net asset acquisitions and divestitures. These incremental costs are excluded as they are incurred to acquire and integrate, or dispose and disintegrate, certain businesses as a result of the acquisition or disposal decision and are unique to each transaction. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies from these transactions. 

We believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination, net asset acquisition or divestiture result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring or disposing of a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business. 

The integration and disintegration costs associated with a business combination, asset acquisition or divestiture may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring, integration or disintegration activities can be lengthy. For example, due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostic business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and/or other regulatory authorities. 

Certain significant items

Adjusted net income is calculated excluding certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be nonrecurring; or items that relate to products that we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to a major non-acquisition or divestiture-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition or divestiture-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by U.S. GAAP; certain asset impairment charges; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; significant currency devaluation; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to legal matters. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies. Our normal, ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

*Calculation not meaningful

(a) The effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income was 21.9% and 19.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. 

The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to higher net discrete tax expenses, less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings (which includes the impact of the location of earnings and repatriation costs) and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. Jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary depending on repatriation decisions, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items.

Analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income

Changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented are primarily related to foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains/(losses) on derivative instruments. The foreign currency translation adjustment changes result from the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business. Unrealized gains/(losses) on the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and reclassified into earnings depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument, as described in Note 9. Financial Instruments of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets 

March 31, 2025 vs. December 31, 2024

For a discussion about the changes in Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt, net of discount and issuance costs, see “Analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” below.

Other current assets increased primarily due to higher prepaid expenses and the deferral of a prepaid tax benefit in connection with a prepayment from a related foreign entity in Belgium, partially offset by the mark-to-market adjustments of derivative instruments.

The net changes in Noncurrent deferred tax assets, Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, Income taxes payable and Other taxes payable primarily reflect adjustments to the accrual for the income tax provision, the timing of income tax payments and the tax impact of various acquisitions.

Other noncurrent assets decreased primarily due to the mark-to-market adjustments of derivative instruments.

Accrued compensation and related items decreased primarily due to the payments of 2024 annual incentive bonuses, savings plan contributions to eligible employees and payments for sales incentive bonuses, as well as the net timing of other payroll activity, partially offset by the accrual of 2025 annual incentive bonuses, sales incentive bonuses and savings plan contributions to eligible employees.

Other current liabilities decreased primarily due to a decrease in collateral received related to derivative contracts, partially offset by the mark-to-market adjustments of derivative instruments.

Operating activities

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. three months ended March 31, 2024

Net cash provided by operating activities was $587 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with $595 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by higher net income adjusted by non-cash items.

Investing activities

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. three months ended March 31, 2024

Our net cash used in investing activities was $175 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with net cash used in investing activities of $131 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was primarily due to capital expenditures. 

Financing activities

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. three months ended March 31, 2024

Our net cash used in financing activities was $677 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with net cash used in financing activities of $524 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily attributable to the purchase of treasury shares, the payment of dividends and taxes paid on withholding shares, partially offset by proceeds in connection with the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan. The net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to the purchase of treasury shares, the payment of dividends and taxes paid on withholding shares, partially offset by proceeds related to short-term borrowings and proceeds in connection with the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan.

Analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources

While we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond, this may be subject to the environment in which we operate. Risks to our meeting future funding requirements are described in Global economic conditions below. 

Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

Certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow:

(a) Accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 45 to 75 days. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding remained within this range. We regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment. 

For additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the Analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets and Analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this MD&A. 

Credit facility and other lines of credit

In December 2022, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multi-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility), which expires in December 2027. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to $1.5 billion. The credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for such period) of 3.50:1. Upon entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4.00:1,

and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition. In addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants. 

We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. There were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of March 31, 2025 or December 31, 2024.

We have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. As of March 31, 2025, we had access to $51 million of lines of credit which expire at various times and are generally renewed annually. There were no borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. 

Domestic and international short-term funds

Many of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. The amount of funds held in the U.S. will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business development activities. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of U.S. and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional U.S. and local income taxes, such as U.S. state income taxes, local withholding taxes, and taxes on currency gains and losses. 

Global economic conditions

Global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic, business and financial volatility. Challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. There can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain financing in the future.

Debt securities

Our senior notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indentures (collectively, the indenture) between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. The indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens or engage in sale lease-back transactions. The indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. In addition, the indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which, the senior notes may be declared immediately due and payable.

Pursuant to the indenture, we are able to redeem the senior notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time by paying a “make whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade of the senior notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, we are, in certain circumstances, required to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.

Our outstanding debt securities are as follows:

Credit ratings

Two major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Share repurchase program

In August 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a multi-year share repurchase program of up to $6 billion of our outstanding common stock. As of March 31, 2025, there was $5.2 billion remaining under this authorization. Purchases of Zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including open market or privately negotiated transactions. During the first three months of 2025, 2.7 million shares were repurchased for $443 million, which excludes a $4 million accrual for excise tax on net share repurchases. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not material. 

New accounting standards

See Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects or expected effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results

This report contains “forward-looking” statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We generally identify forward-looking statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “project,” “plan,” “predict,” “believe,” “seek,” “continue,” “outlook,” "forecast,” “objective,” “target,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “can have,” “likely” or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance, actions or events.

In particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future actions, business plans or prospects, prospective products, product approvals or products under development, product and supply chain disruption, R&D costs, timing and likelihood of success, future operating or financial performance, future results of current and anticipated products and services, product strategies, sales efforts, expenses, production efficiencies, production margins, anticipated timing of generic market entries, integration of acquired businesses, anticipated impact of timing of divestitures, interest rates, tax rates, tariffs, changes in tax regimes and laws, foreign exchange rates, growth in emerging markets, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans related to share repurchases and dividends, government regulation, taxes and financial results. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, actions or events. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are based on assumptions that could prove to be inaccurate. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:

•the possible impact and timing of competing products, including generic alternatives, on our products and our ability to compete against such products;

•unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns or issues about our products;

•the economic, political, legal and business environment of the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business;

•the decline in global economic conditions, economic weakness in China and inflation;

•consolidation of our customers and distributors;

•changes in the distribution channel for companion animal products;

•an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals;

•disruptive innovations and advances in medical practices and technologies;

•perceived adverse effects linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products or animals generally;

•increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising, processing or consumption of food-producing animals;

•modification of foreign trade policy by the U.S. or other countries, including the imposition of increased tariffs on imported or exported goods;

•adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources;

•the impact of climate change on our activities and the activities of our customers and suppliers;

•a cyberattack, information security breach or other misappropriation of our data;

•governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations, including without limitation, delays in the United States resulting from federal workforce reductions or hiring freezes, federal agency reorganizations or deregulatory efforts, or tax obligations and changes affecting the tax treatment by the U.S. of income earned outside the U.S. that may result from pending or possible future proposals;

•failure to protect our intellectual property rights or to operate our business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others;

•the other factors set forth under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part I of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A. of Part II in this Form 10-Q.

However, there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. These risks or uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. You should not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q and 8-K reports and our other filings with the SEC. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the above to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

A significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings. We manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments. These practices may change as economic conditions change.

For a complete discussion of our exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk, refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no material changes from the information discussed therein.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation as of March 31, 2025, the company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable level of assurance in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

The information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in Part I— Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the "Our operating environment" and "Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results" sections of the MD&A and in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors," of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results and which are incorporated by reference herein. Set forth below are updates to certain of the risk factors disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Risks related to our business and the animal health industry

Modification of foreign trade policy by the U.S. or other countries or the imposition of tariffs on imported goods may harm our business.

The U.S. and other countries in which our products are sourced or sold, or we or our customers do business, may from time to time modify existing or impose new quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs or other restrictions in a manner that adversely affects us. For example, the recent announcements of substantial new tariffs and other restrictive trade policies have created a dynamic and unpredictable trade landscape.

Current or future tariffs or other restrictive trade measures may raise the costs of raw materials, components or finished goods, which may adversely impact both our product offerings and our operational expenses. Our manufacturers, suppliers and distribution channels are also affected by the current trade environment, and we may experience supply chain disruptions as a result of increased costs and uncertainty. Tariff and other trade-related cost pressures and supply chain disruptions may lead to reputational harm if we are unable to deliver products or services on expected timelines or if any price increases are poorly received by customers or business partners.

Additional tariffs on imports could result in a negative perception and/or an increased cost of goods and higher prices which may reduce customer demand for products, or extended sales cycles as customers assess the impact of evolving trade policies on their operations and face increased costs or decreased revenue due to tariffs and trade restrictions. Additionally, a number of our customers, particularly U.S.-based livestock producers, benefit from free trade agreements, the loss of which could impact their operating results and spending power. 

In addition, retaliatory trade policies or anti-U.S. sentiment in certain regions whether driven by trade tensions, political disagreements or regulatory concerns may make customers, governments and investors more hesitant to engage with, purchase from or invest in U.S. companies. This may lead to increased preference for local competitors, changes to government procurement policies or heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may result in heightened operational risks and difficulties for us in attracting and retaining non-U.S. customers, suppliers, partners and investors. 

While the scope and duration of any tariffs remains uncertain, tariffs imposed by the U.S. or other governments on our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other components thereof could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Risks related to manufacturing and supply

We rely on third parties to provide us with products, materials and services, and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply.

The materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, tariffs, economic climate and other factors. In addition, labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor, governmental regulations, tariffs, economic climate and other factors. Increases in the demand for, availability or the price of, materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products, result in product delivery delays or shortages, and impact our ability to launch new products on a timely basis or at all. We may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher product, material, transportation or labor costs on to our customers, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 

Certain third-party suppliers are the sole or exclusive source of certain products, materials and services necessary for production of our products. We may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our third-party suppliers cease or interrupt operations due to, among other things, escalating tensions or trade disputes in their region, restrictions on the import/export of goods or services, contract manufacturing or supply chain disruptions due to contract manufacturer or supplier financial distress, our failure to mutually renew contract terms, or some other failure of a contractor or supplier to meet their obligations to us. In such a case, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of our agreement or pursue a strategic transaction or other alternative arrangement with that supplier or others.

Risks related to legal matters and regulation

Our business is subject to substantial regulation.

As a global company, we are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations, including regulations relating to the research, development, quality assurance, manufacturing, importation, exportation, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, including our in vitro diagnostic products used in human health. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, the USDA and foreign equivalents. Our failure, or the failure of third parties we rely on, including CMOs, to comply with these regulatory requirements, allegations of such non-compliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in, among other things, inspectional observation notices, label changes, untitled or warning letters or other public regulatory communications or correspondence, fines, a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated, withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market, product seizures, injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a

result of negative publicity and product liability claims. Any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

In addition, we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products. Even after a product reaches market, it may be subject to re-review and may lose its approvals. We have changed, and may in the future change, the locations of where certain of our products are manufactured and, because of these changes, we may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals. Our failure to obtain approvals, delays in the approval process, including any delays in the United States resulting from federal workforce reductions or hiring freezes, federal agency reorganizations or deregulatory efforts, or any prolonged shutdown of the U.S. government, or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction, may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained, if ever.

The OFAC at the U.S. Treasury Department and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), and similar agencies in other countries and territories outside the U.S., administer certain laws and regulations that restrict its persons and, in some instances, extraterritorial persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to economic sanctions. Our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities, and individuals, and are constantly changing. For example, we sell limited humanitarian animal health products, including medicines, diagnostics and vaccines, to Russia and Iran, in compliance with economic sanctions affecting these countries. Violations of sanctions regulations may be punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees and agents. For example, in December 2020, we submitted a final voluntary disclosure to OFAC and the U.S. Department of Justice regarding certain transactions involving sales of food, medicine or devices to individuals or entities who may have been resident in or had ties to Iran potentially in violation of the ITSR administered by OFAC. The sales were made by our Platinum Performance business, which we acquired in August 2019. In July 2023, OFAC provided a No Action letter confirming a final determination that no further action would be taken in the matter. We do not anticipate further communication from the Department of Justice as the statutory response period has lapsed without a response. 

A failure to comply with the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject, including any permits issued thereunder, may result in environmental remediation costs, loss of permits, public regulatory communications or announcements, fines, penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures. We cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

There has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulation aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. Such regulations apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or could have interests in the future. The EU adopted the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that will require disclosure by EU entities, including certain EU subsidiaries of non-EU entities, regarding the risks and opportunities arising from environmental, social and corporate governance issues, and on the impact of companies' activities on people and the environment. Similarly, the State of California passed the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that imposes broad climate-related disclosure obligations on certain companies doing business in California, including us. Any new regulation could take several forms that could result in additional costs in the form of investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations and taxes. Climate change regulation continues to evolve, and it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation.

We are also subject to chemical regulation in the United States and internationally. For example, governmental authorities in the EU and the United States are increasingly focused on preventing environmental contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which may be contained in certain of our products or product packaging. Federal and state governments and regulatory agencies, like the European Chemicals Agency, are in various stages of considering and/or implementing laws and regulations requiring the reporting, restriction and/or phase-out of PFAS-containing products (subject to applicable product exceptions). 

Furthermore, we cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, or changes in tax laws and tariffs, nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated. Changes in applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
