Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

  

1\. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

  

Basis of Presentation

  

The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of GXO Logistics, Inc. (“GXO” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.

  

Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2025. The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of GXO and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company has eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions.

  

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Certain amounts reported for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.

  

The Company presents its operations as one reportable segment.

  

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

  

In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules designed to enhance public company disclosures related to the risks and impacts of climate-related matters. The new rules include disclosures relating to climate-related risks and risk management, as well as the board and management’s governance of such risks. In addition, the rules include requirements to disclose the financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in the audited financial statements. Larger registrants will also be required to disclose information about greenhouse gas emissions, which will be subject to a phased-in assurance requirement. The disclosures are required for annual periods ending December 31, 2025. In April 2024, the SEC issued an order staying the implementation of the new climate-related disclosure rules pending completion of judicial review of consolidated changes to the rules by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In February 2025, the SEC requested that the court not schedule the matter for argument in order to allow time for the SEC to determine appropriate next steps. On March 27, 2025, the SEC voted to end its legal defense of the final rules, although judicial review remains ongoing. The Company continues to monitor developments and evaluate the potential impact of these rules on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

  

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which provides for expanded disclosures primarily related to income taxes paid and the rate reconciliation. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the disclosure requirements about income taxes paid and the rate reconciliation in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

  

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. This standard requires all public companies to disclose more detailed information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to the financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the disclosure requirements about specific expense categories in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

3\. Segment Information

  

The Company is organized geographically into three operating segments: i) Americas and Asia-Pacific, ii) United Kingdom and Ireland, and iii) Continental Europe. The Company’s reporting unit results are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who assesses the Company’s performance and allocates resources.

  

The CODM evaluates the Company’s performance and allocates resources primarily based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for transaction and integration costs, restructuring costs, litigation expense, and unrealized gain/loss on foreign currency contracts and other adjustments (“Adjusted EBITDA”). The CODM uses Adjusted EBITDA to communicate performance targets to the segment managers, allocate resources to the segments, and to monitor segment performance. Additionally, the CODM considers the performance of this measure against planned and forecasted amounts to make investing and resource allocation decisions. The actual results are used in assessing performance of the Company and in establishing management’s compensation.

  

For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three operating segments into one reportable segment.

  

The Company’s segment results were as follows:

Wincanton Acquisition

  

On April 29, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Wincanton plc for total consideration of approximately £762 million ($958 million as of acquisition date) (the “Wincanton Acquisition”). The Wincanton Acquisition is subject to a review by the Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) in the U.K., which is expected to be completed by June 25, 2025. 

  

In connection with the Wincanton Acquisition, the Company incurred transaction costs of $21 million and $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which were included in Transaction and integration costs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(1) The Company acquired $529 million of intangible assets, comprised of customer relationships, trade names, and intellectual property with weighted-average useful lives of 12.5 years.

(2) Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill acquired was recorded in the U.K. and Ireland reporting unit and was primarily attributed to anticipated synergies. The Company does not expect the goodwill recognized in connection with the Wincanton Acquisition to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered preliminary and subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained and reviewed. The final allocation of the purchase price may differ from the preliminary allocation based on completion of the valuation. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to intangible assets, goodwill, other long-term assets, lease assets and liabilities, accrued expenses, and income taxes. The Company expects to finalize the purchase price allocation within the measurement period, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.

8\. Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments

  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:

  

•Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;

•Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and

•Level 3—Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable, generally utilizing pricing models or other valuation techniques that reflect management’s judgment and estimates.

  

Assets and Liabilities

  

The Company bases its fair value estimates on market assumptions and available information. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current maturities of long-term debt approximated their fair values as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, due to their short-term nature.

10\. Stockholders’ Equity

  

Stock Repurchase Plan

  

On February 18, 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized and announced the repurchase of up to $500 million (the “Repurchase Plan”) of its common stock. The Repurchase Plan permits shares of common stock to be repurchased from time to time in management’s discretion, through a variety of methods, including a 10b5-1 trading plan, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and number of shares of common stock repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, alternative investment opportunities and funding considerations. The Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

  

The repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock is recorded as treasury stock within equity and is accounted for under the cost method inclusive of share repurchase costs and excise tax on share repurchases in excess of issuances. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $111 million, including share repurchase costs and excise tax.

11\. Employee Benefit Plans

  

Defined Benefit Plans

  

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension schemes in the U.K. (the “U.K. Retirement Plans”). The funded status of the U.K. Retirement Plans was recorded in Other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The U.K. Retirement Plans do not allow for new plan participants or additional benefit accruals.

  

The Company considers other international retirement plans to be immaterial to its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and they are excluded from the below disclosure.

  

Components of the net periodic benefit income recognized under the U.K. Retirement Plans were as follows:

(1) Defined contribution costs were primarily recorded in Direct operating expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

  

12\. Restructuring Costs and Other

  

Restructuring costs primarily related to severance, including projects to optimize the Company’s finance, human resources and information technology functions, and closing certain corporate and administrative offices, which were not associated with customer attrition.

  

The following table summarizes changes in the restructuring liability, which is included in other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

As of March 31, 2025, $16 million of the restructuring liability is expected to be paid within the next 12 months.

  

13\. Income Taxes

  

Income tax for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was a $2 million income tax expense compared with a $10 million income tax benefit for the same period in 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months 

17

* * *

  

ended March 31, 2025, was an expense on a pre-tax loss of (2.7)%, compared to a benefit on a pre-tax loss of 21.1% for the same period in 2024. The change to the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily driven by non-deductible transaction costs and a non-deductible regulatory matter.

  

In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) issued administrative guidance for the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion rules (“Pillar Two”), which generally imposes a 15% global minimum tax on multinational companies. Many Pillar Two rules are effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2024, with other aspects to be effective from 2025. The Company has reviewed its global legal entity structure and considered all the jurisdictions for which the Company is potentially subject to Pillar Two. The Company has determined that most of its entities are not subject to Pillar Two, because these jurisdictions either are subject to tax in excess of 15%, can apply a safe-harbor, or the entities are organized in jurisdictions that have not (yet) fully enacted Pillar Two. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, Pillar Two did not have a material impact on the Company’s income tax expense/benefit. Pillar Two did not have a significant impact on the Company’s fiscal 2024 and the Company currently does not expect it to have a significant impact on its fiscal 2025 income tax expense.

  

14\. Commitments and Contingencies

  

The Company is involved, and will continue to be involved, in numerous legal proceedings arising from the conduct of its business. These proceedings may include personal injury claims arising from the transportation and handling of goods, contractual disputes and employment-related claims, including alleged violations of wage and hour laws.

  

The Company establishes accruals for specific legal proceedings when it is considered probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews and adjusts accruals for loss contingencies quarterly and as additional information becomes available. If a loss is not both probable and reasonably estimable, or if an exposure to a loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, the Company assesses whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional loss, may have been incurred. If there is a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional loss, may have been incurred, the Company discloses the estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if it is material and an estimate can be made, or discloses that such an estimate cannot be made. The determination as to whether a loss can reasonably be considered to be possible or probable is based on management’s assessment, together with legal counsel, regarding the ultimate outcome of the matter.

  

Management of the Company believes that it has adequately accrued for the potential impact of loss contingencies that are probable and reasonably estimable. Management of the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any matters to which the Company is presently a party will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Legal costs related to these matters are expensed as they are incurred.

  

The Company carries liability and excess umbrella insurance policies that are deemed sufficient to cover potential legal claims arising in the normal course of conducting its operations. In the event the Company is required to satisfy a legal claim outside the scope of the coverage provided by insurance, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively impacted.

  

On July 2, 2024, the Italian authorities launched an investigation into the deductibility of value-added tax payments by the Company to certain third-party service providers. The challenged amount is €84 million ($91 million as of March 31, 2025). As of March 31, 2025, the Company deposited €84 million ($91 million as of March 31, 2025) into a designated bank account in connection with the ongoing investigation. This amount is classified as restricted cash under “Current Assets” in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In April 2025, the Company made a partial payment of €15 million ($17 million) to the Italian authorities funded from the designated bank account reducing the restricted cash balance. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company accrued €61 million ($66 million) of expense associated with this contingency which is recorded within the Regulatory matter and litigation expense line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the probable and reasonably

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other written reports and oral statements we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target,” “trajectory” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to a material difference include those discussed below and the risks discussed in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All forward-looking statements set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations.

  

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on February 18, 2025 (the “2024 Form 10-K”), and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

  

Business Overview

  

GXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“GXO,” the “Company,” “our” or “we”), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world and a foremost innovator in the industry. We provide our customers with high-value-added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services differentiated by our ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at scale. Our customers rely on us to move their goods with high efficiency through their supply chains — from the moment goods arrive at our warehouses through fulfillment and distribution, and the management of returned products. Our customer base includes many blue-chip leaders in sectors that demonstrate high growth and/or durable demand, with significant growth potential through customer outsourcing of logistics services.

  

Our business model is asset-light and historically resilient in cycles, with high returns, strong free cash flow and visibility into revenue and earnings. The vast majority of our contracts with customers are long-term in nature, and our warehouse lease arrangements generally align with contract length. The Company has both fixed-price contracts (closed book or hybrid contracts) and cost-plus contracts (open book contracts). Most of our customer contracts contain both fixed and variable components. The fixed component is typically designed to cover warehouse, technology and equipment costs, while the variable component is determined based on expected volumes and associated labor costs. Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company’s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, the Company will generate more or less profit. Cost-plus contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during the performance of the contract plus a specified margin.

On April 29, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Wincanton plc (“Wincanton”), a U.K. logistics provider specializing in both warehousing and transportation solutions (“the Wincanton Acquisition”). The Wincanton Acquisition is subject to a review by the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K., which is expected to be completed by June 25, 2025. Due to the acquisition of Wincanton in 2024, comparisons in our results of operations between 2025 and 2024 are less meaningful. For additional information regarding our acquisitions see Note 5. “Acquisition” in Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loss before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $93 million compared with $46 million for the same period in 2024. The increase in loss before income taxes was primarily due to higher SG&A expense, higher depreciation, amortization and interest expense, and lower other income, net.

  

Income tax for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was a $2 million income tax expense compared with a $10 million income tax benefit for the same period in 2024. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was an expense on a pre-tax loss of (2.7)%, compared to a benefit on a pre-tax loss of 21.1% for the 

22

* * *

  

same period in 2024. The change to our effective tax rate was primarily driven by non-deductible transaction costs and a non-deductible regulatory matter.

  

For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion rules issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“Pillar Two”) did not have a material impact on our income tax expense/benefit. Pillar Two did not have a significant impact on our fiscal 2024 and we currently do not expect it to have a significant impact on our fiscal 2025 income tax expense.

  

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  

Our ability to fund our operations and anticipated capital needs is reliant upon the generation of cash from operations, supplemented as necessary by periodic utilization of our revolving credit facility and factoring programs. Our principal uses of cash in the future will be primarily to fund our operations, working capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment of borrowings and strategic business development transactions. The timing and magnitude of our new contract start-ups can vary and may positively or negatively impact our cash flows. We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements and capital structure in light of our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources.

  

As of March 31, 2025, we held cash and cash equivalents of $288 million and restricted cash of $94 million, and we had $949 million of borrowing capacity, net of letters of credit under our revolving credit facilities.

  

As of March 31, 2025, we deposited €84 million ($91 million as of March 31, 2025) of restricted cash in relation to a contingency. In April 2025, we made a partial payment of €15 million ($17 million) against this contingency funded from the designated bank account reducing the restricted cash balance. For additional information regarding our regulatory and legal matters see Note 14. “Commitments and Contingencies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

  

On February 18, 2025, our board of directors authorized and announced the repurchase of up to $500 million (the “Repurchase Plan”) of our common stock. The Repurchase Plan permits shares of common stock to be repurchased from time to time in management’s discretion, through a variety of methods, including a 10b5-1 trading plan, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and number of shares of common stock repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, alternative investment opportunities and funding considerations. We will fund the repurchases with existing cash, borrowings on our revolving credit facility, and/or other financing sources. The Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of March 31, 2025, the remaining authorization under the Repurchase Plan was approximately $390 million.

  

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations, the revolving credit facilities, and the use of our factoring programs will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months.

  

For additional information regarding our cash requirement from lease obligations, indebtedness and contractual obligations, see Note 4. “Leases”, Note 7. “Debt and Financing Arrangements” and Note 14. “Commitments and Contingencies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Operating Activities

  

Cash flows provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 decreased by $21 million compared with the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to less cash generated from income partially offset by lower working capital consumption for the three months ended March 31, 2025.

  

Investing Activities

  

Investing activities used $77 million of cash for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and $82 million for the same period in 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we used $78 million of cash to purchase property and equipment and received $1 million of cash from sales of property and equipment. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we used $73 million of cash to purchase property and equipment, $15 million to purchase Wincanton shares and received $6 million of cash from sales of property and equipment.

Financing Activities

  

Financing activities used $66 million and $8 million of cash for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The primary use of cash from financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $106 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the Repurchase Plan, $11 million to repay finance lease obligations and $6 million in payments for employee taxes on net settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $56 million of net borrowings under revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash from financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $8 million to repay finance lease obligations and $4 million in payments for employee taxes on net settlement of equity awards.

  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

  

We do not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

  

Contractual Obligations

  

As of March 31, 2025, the Company’s contractual obligations had not materially changed compared with December 31, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

  

We are exposed to market risk that may impact our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements due primarily to variable rate long-term debt obligations and fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. To reduce our exposure to market risk associated with interest and foreign currency exchange rate risks, we enter into various derivative instruments. There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risk for the three months ended March 31, 2025, from those previously disclosed in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” contained in Part II, Item 7A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

  

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of March 31, 2025. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025 were effective as of such time such that the information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to the Company, including our consolidated subsidiaries and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

  

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

  

On February 18, 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized and announced the repurchase of up to $500 million (the “Repurchase Plan”) of its common stock. The Repurchase Plan permits shares of common stock to be repurchased from time to time in management’s discretion, through a variety of methods, including a 10b5-1 trading plan, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

  

The following table presents our repurchase activity on a cash basis during the first quarter of 2025:

We reflect the costs associated with the repurchase and the 1% excise tax within equity as part of the repurchase cost of the common stock. For additional information regarding the Repurchase Plan, see Note 10. “Stockholders’ Equity” in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
