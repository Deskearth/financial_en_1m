1.BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (Mettler-Toledo or the Company) is a leading global supplier of precision instruments and services. The Company manufactures weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, packaging, logistics and food retailing applications. The Company also manufactures several related analytical instruments and provides automated chemistry solutions used in drug and chemical compound discovery and development. In addition, the Company manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging and provides solutions for use in certain process analytics applications. The Company's primary manufacturing facilities are located in China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Mexico. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Columbus, Ohio and Greifensee, Switzerland.

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include all entities in which the Company has control, which are its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods presented. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These financial statements were prepared using information reasonably available as of March 31, 2025 and through the date of this report. Actual results may differ from those estimates due to uncertainty around the ongoing developments related to global trade/tariffs, and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as other factors. 

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

  

2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Trade Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for expected credit losses represents the Company's best estimate based on historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and circumstances.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments to the cost basis of the Company’s inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage, orders and technological obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required in the future.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the net asset value of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of the assets are less than their carrying amounts. 

Other intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets and assets subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be benefited. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company assesses the initial acquisition of intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805 “Business Combinations” and the continued accounting for previously recognized intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350 “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other” and ASC 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment.” 

Other intangible assets consisted of the following:

Revenue Recognition

Product revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when a customer has obtained control of a product. The Company considers control to have transferred based upon shipping terms. To the extent the Company’s arrangements have a separate performance obligation, revenue related to any

post-shipment performance obligation is deferred until completed. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is a component of cost of sales. Certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the end customer. Revenue is recognized on these distributor arrangements upon transfer of control to the distributor. Contracts do not contain variable pricing arrangements that are retrospective, except for rebate programs. Rebates are estimated based on expected sales volumes and offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized. The Company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits. The related provisions for estimated returns and rebates are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

Certain of the Company’s product arrangements include separate performance obligations, primarily related to installation. Such performance obligations are accounted for separately when the deliverables have stand-alone value and the satisfaction of the undelivered performance obligations is probable and within the Company's control. The allocation of revenue between the performance obligations is based on the observable stand-alone selling prices at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates, time to install, and geographic location.

Software is generally not considered a distinct performance obligation with the exception of a limited number of software applications. The Company primarily sells software products with the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the product. The Company’s products typically require no significant production, modification, or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products. 

Service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed. Revenue from spare parts sold on a stand-alone basis is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery. Revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period using a time-based method. These contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, and preventative maintenance on a customer’s pre-defined equipment over the contract period.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense within selling, general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income with a corresponding offset to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognized $5.1 million and $4.7 million of share-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Research and Development

Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries, consulting and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as incurred.

Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions

The Company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations utilizing the acquisition method of accounting. The results of each acquisition are included in the Company's consolidated results as of the acquisition date. The purchase price of an acquisition is generally allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values and any consideration in excess of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. The determination of the values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including goodwill and intangible assets, require significant judgement. Acquisition transaction costs are expensed when incurred.

In circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the expected contingent payments as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded to other charges (income), net.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires incremental disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment or the guidance for determining reportable segments. The Company adopted these annual disclosure requirements on a retrospective basis in 2024. See Note 13 for the quarterly reportable segments disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances income tax disclosures, especially related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The Company will adopt the annual disclosure requirements in 2025 and is currently evaluating the impact of these requirements on the consolidated financial statements.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03: Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires disclosures about the nature of expenses presented on the face of the income statement. The Company will adopt the annual disclosure requirements in 2027 and is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

A breakdown of net sales to external customers by geographic customer destination for the three months ended March 31 follows:

Total                 $        883,744                 $  925,949    

The Company's global revenue mix by product category is laboratory (56% of sales), industrial (39% of sales) and retail (5% of sales). The Company's product revenue by reportable segment is proportionately similar to the Company's global revenue mix except the Company's Swiss Operations is largely comprised of laboratory products, while the Company's Chinese Operations has a slightly higher percentage of industrial products. A breakdown of the Company’s sales by product category for the three months ended March 31 follows:

Total       $        883,744                 $  925,949    

The payment terms in the Company’s contracts with customers do not exceed one year and therefore contracts do not contain a significant financing component. In most cases, after appropriate credit evaluations, payments are due in arrears and are recognized as receivables. Unbilled revenue is recorded when performance obligations have been satisfied, but not yet billed to the customer. Unbilled revenue as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was $34.6 million and $32.6 million, respectively, and is included within accounts receivable. Deferred revenue and customer prepayments are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of the performance obligation being satisfied. Deferred revenue primarily includes prepaid service contracts, as well as deferred installation.

The Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the contract period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. The value of unsatisfied performance obligations other than customer prepayments and deferred revenue associated with contracts greater than one year is immaterial.

  

4\. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company enters into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The amount of the Company's fixed obligation interest payments may change based upon the expiration dates of its interest rate swap agreements and the level and composition of its debt. The Company also enters into certain foreign currency forward contracts to limit the Company's exposure to currency fluctuations on the respective hedged items. For additional disclosures on derivative instruments regarding balance sheet location, fair value, and the amounts reclassified into other comprehensive income and the effective portions of the cash flow hedges, also see Notes 5 and 9 to the interim consolidated financial statements. As also mentioned in Note 7, the Company

has designated its euro-denominated debt as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated foreign subsidiaries. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

The Company has entered into a number of cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. The agreements convert borrowings under the Company’s credit facility into synthetic Swiss franc debt, which allows the Company to effectively change the floating rate SOFR-based interest payments, excluding the credit spread, to a fixed Swiss franc income or expense as follows:

The Company's cash flow hedges are recorded gross at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. A derivative gain of $4.7 million based upon interest rates at March 31, 2025, is expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the next twelve months. The cash flow hedges remain effective as of March 31, 2025.

Other Derivatives

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts in order to economically hedge short-term trade and non-trade intercompany balances largely denominated in Swiss franc, other major European currencies, and the Chinese renminbi with its foreign businesses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these contracts are considered “derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.” Gains or losses on these instruments are reported in current earnings. The foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, as disclosed in Note 5. The Company recognized in other charges (income) a net gain of $1.3 million and net gain of $8.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which offset the related transaction gains (losses) associated with these contracts. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, these contracts had a notional value of $813.1 million and $788.6 million, respectively.

5\. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had derivative assets totaling $1.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, and derivative liabilities totaling $12.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and therefore does not present all the required disclosures in tabular format. The fair values of the interest rate swap agreements, the cross currency swap agreements, and the foreign currency forward contracts that economically hedge short-term intercompany balances are estimated based upon inputs from current valuation information obtained from dealer quotes and priced with observable market assumptions and appropriate valuation adjustments for credit risk. The Company has evaluated the valuation methodologies used to develop the fair values by dealers in order to determine whether such valuations are representative of an exit price in the Company’s principal market. In addition, the Company uses an internally developed model to perform testing on the valuations received from brokers. The Company has also considered both

its own credit risk and counterparty credit risk in determining fair value and determined these adjustments were insignificant at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. 

Under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement consists of observable and unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.

A fair value hierarchy has been established that categorizes these inputs into three levels:

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities

Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities

Level 3: Unobservable inputs 

The following table presents the Company’s assets and liabilities, which are all categorized as Level 2 and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities which are categorized as Level 1.

The Company had $8.2 million and $3.7 million of cash equivalents at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, the fair value of which is determined using Level 2 inputs, through quoted and corroborated prices in active markets. The fair value of cash equivalents approximates cost.

The fair value of the Company's debt is less than the carrying value by approximately $194.0 million as of March 31, 2025. The fair value of the Company's fixed interest rate debt was estimated using Level 2 inputs, primarily utilizing discounted cash flow models based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company.

  

6\. INCOME TAXES

The Company's reported tax rate was 19.0% and 19.5% during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The provision for taxes is based upon using the Company's projected annual effective tax rate of 19.0% before non-recurring discrete tax items during both 2025 and 2024. The difference between the Company's projected annual effective tax rate and the reported tax rate is related to the timing of excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises.

(a) The benchmark interest rate is determined by the borrowing currency. The benchmark rates by borrowing currency are as follows: SOFR for U.S. dollars (plus a 10 basis points spread adjustment), SARON for Swiss franc, EURIBOR for Euro and SONIA for Great British pounds. 

On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a $1.35 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended its $1.25 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement). As of March 31, 2025, the Company had $679.8 million of additional borrowings available under its Credit Agreement, and the Company maintained $64.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. 

The Credit Agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions (similar to the Company's Prior Credit Agreement) and has a maturity date of May 30, 2029. It is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company must also pay facility fees that are tied to its leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that are similar to those contained in the Prior Credit Agreement, with which the Company was in compliance as of December 31, 2024. The Company is required to maintain (i) a ratio of net funded indebtedness to EBITDA of 3.5 to 1.0 or less except in certain circumstances and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 or greater. The Credit Agreement also places certain limitations on the Company, including limiting the ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level. In addition, the Credit Agreement has several events of default, with customary grace periods as applicable. 

In January 2025, the Company entered into an agreement to issue and sell EUR 100 million 10 1/2-year Senior Notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.8% (3.8% Euro Senior Notes) in a private placement,

which will mature in July 2035. The 3.8% Euro Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company, and the terms are consistent with the previous Notes as disclosed in Note 10 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. 

The Company has designated the EUR 125 million 1.47% Euro Senior Notes, the EUR 135 million 1.30% Euro Senior Notes, the EUR 125 million 1.06% Euro Senior Notes, and the EUR 100 million 3.80% Euro Senior Notes as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in a euro denominated foreign subsidiary to reduce foreign currency risk associated with this net investment. Changes in the carrying value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income (loss). The Company recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) related to this net investment hedge an unrealized loss of $19.2 million and unrealized gain of $8.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company has a gain of $23.1 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of March 31, 2025.

Other Local Arrangements

In 2018, two of the Company's non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions which include an interest rate of SARON plus 87.5 basis points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2025.

  

8\. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND TREASURY STOCK

The Company has $1.5 billion of remaining availability for its share repurchase program as of March 31, 2025.

13\. SEGMENT REPORTING

As disclosed in Note 18 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company has determined there are five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations and Other.

Our reportable segments comprise the structure used by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), to make key operating decisions and assess performance. The Company evaluates performance based on segment profit for segment reporting (gross profit less research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses, before amortization, interest expense, restructuring charges, other charges (income), net, and taxes).

The following tables show the operations of the Company’s reportable segments:

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

  

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

General

Our interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025.

Changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates. We believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods. We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results.

We also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified. Although the impact of such factors is not considered material, we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results.

Results of Operations – Consolidated

The following tables set forth items from our interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 (amounts in thousands).

Recent developments in global trade disputes/tariffs

In 2025, the U.S. government enacted an incremental 10% tariff on imported products as well as higher tariffs on imports from certain other countries, including an additional 145% tariff on imports from China and a 25% tariff on non-USMCA products imported from Mexico. In response, the Chinese government implemented additional tariffs of 125% on imports from the U.S. The tariffs became effective at various points during 2025, especially in April 2025. We estimate the associated annualized cost increase of the incremental 2025 tariffs is approximately $115 million (assuming the 

\- 22 -

above rates). The U.S. government has indicated it may make further changes to tariff rates in the future. We are implementing various actions to mitigate the effect of the tariffs. 

The recent escalation in global trade disputes/tariffs has increased economic uncertainty in our end markets and the global economic environment, including increasing the risk of recession in many countries, and market conditions may change quickly. Although we are implementing various actions to mitigate the effect of the tariffs, they could adversely impact our financial results and could have a greater impact on our operating results in future periods. Please refer to Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for more information. 

Net sales

Net sales were $883.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $925.9 million for the corresponding period in 2024. Sales decreased 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies for the three months ended March 31, 2025. We estimate that net sales growth for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was reduced approximately 6% from the recovery of previously disclosed shipping delays during the three months ended March 31, 2024 related to a new external European logistics service provider. Excluding this impact, sales increased 3% in local currency for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024. 

We continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs, our innovative product portfolio, and investments in our field organization, particularly surrounding digital tools and techniques. However, the recent escalation in global trade disputes/tariffs has increased uncertainty in our end markets and the global economic environment, including increasing the risk of recession in many countries, and market conditions may change quickly. The ongoing developments related to global trade disputes/tariffs, Ukraine, and the conflict in the Middle East also present several risks to our business as further described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. These topics could adversely impact our financial results and could have a greater impact on our operating results in future periods. 

Net sales by geographic destination for the three months ended March 31, 2025 in U.S. dollars decreased 2% in the Americas, 9% in Europe, and 4% in Asia/Rest of World. In local currencies, our net sales by geographic destination decreased 1% in the Americas, 7% in Europe, and 2% in Asia/Rest of World, including flat sales in China, for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024. Excluding the impact of the recovery of delayed shipments in the prior year, local currency sales increased 3% in the Americas, 4% in Europe, and 3% in Asia/Rest of World, with 3% in China, during the three months ended March 31, 2025. A discussion of sales by operating segment is included below.

As described in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services, including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, preventative maintenance and spare parts.

Net sales of products decreased 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year period. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency during the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024. 

Net sales of our laboratory products and services, which represented approximately 56% of our total net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2025, decreased 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Laboratory net sales growth was reduced by approximately 8%, from the recovery of previously disclosed shipping delays, during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Excluding this impact, the local currency net sales increase in our laboratory-related products includes growth in most product categories with strong growth in process analytics. 

Net sales of our industrial products and services, which represented approximately 39% of our total net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2025, decreased 3% in U.S. dollars and 1% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Industrial net sales growth was 

\- 23 -

Table of Contents

reduced by approximately 3%, from the recovery of previously disclosed shipping delays, during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Excluding this impact, the local currency net sales increase in our industrial-related products includes strong growth in product inspection, offset in part by a modest decline in core-industrial products.

Net sales in our food retailing products and services, which represented approximately 5% of our total net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2025, decreased 14% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Retail net sales growth was reduced by approximately 7%, from the recovery of previously disclosed shipping delays, during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Excluding this impact, the local currency net sales decrease in food retailing products reflects the timing of project activity, particularly in Europe.

Gross profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 59.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to 59.2% for the corresponding period in 2024.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 61.6% and 61.2% for the three month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. 

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including spare parts) was 53.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to 52.9% for the corresponding period in 2024.

The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily reflects favorable price realization and benefits from our SternDrive program, partially offset by lower sales volume related to the recovery of shipping delays in the prior year.

We expect our gross margin during the remainder of 2025 will be negatively impacted by the recent escalation in global trade disputes/tariffs. As previously mentioned, we are implementing various actions to mitigate the effect of the tariffs. 

Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses

Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was 5.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to 5.0% in the corresponding period of 2024. Research and development expenses were flat in U.S. dollars and increased 2% in local currencies, during the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to 25.3% in the corresponding period of 2024. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024. The local currency increase includes sales and marketing investments and the timing of certain costs.

Amortization, interest expense, restructuring charges, other charges (income), net and taxes

Amortization expense was $17.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and $18.2 million for the corresponding period in 2024. 

Interest expense was $16.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and $19.2 million for the corresponding period in 2024. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to lower variable interest rates and lower debt.

Restructuring charges were $3.8 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Restructuring expenses are primarily comprised of employee-related costs.

Other charges (income), net includes non-service pension costs (benefits), net (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activities, interest income and other items. Non-service pension benefits for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were $3.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively.

The provision for taxes is based upon using our projected annual effective tax rate of 19.0% before non-recurring discrete tax items for the three month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The difference between our projected annual effective tax rate and the reported tax rate is related to the timing of excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises.

Total net sales decreased 1% and net sales to external customers were flat for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared with the corresponding period in 2024. The growth in net sales to external customers during the three months ended March 31, 2025 was reduced by approximately 3% from the recovery of previously disclosed shipping delays during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Excluding this impact, the increase in net sales to external customers for the three months ended March 31, 2025 includes strong growth in process analytics and product inspection, partially offset by a decline in core-industrial products.

Segment profit decreased $9.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024. Segment profit during the three months ended March 31, 2025 includes lower sales volume from our previously disclosed shipping delay recovery in the prior year and higher expenses.

Total net sales decreased 2% in U.S. dollars and increased 2% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024. Net sales to external customers decreased 5% in U.S. dollars and 1% in local currency for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024. The growth in net sales to external customers during the three months ended March 31, 2025 was reduced by approximately 9% from the recovery of previously disclosed shipping delays during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Excluding this impact, the increase in net sales to external customers in local currency for the three months ended March 31, 2025 includes strong growth in laboratory products, as well as product inspection. 

Segment profit decreased $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024. The decrease in segment profit is primarily due to lower volume from our previously disclosed shipping delay recovery in the prior year and unfavorable currency, offset in part by benefits from our margin expansion initiatives. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes available borrowings under our Credit Agreement, the ability to obtain appropriate financing and our cash and cash equivalent balances. Currently, our liquidity needs are primarily driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions. Global market conditions can be uncertain, and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets.

We currently believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement, local working capital facilities, and cash balances, will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future. 

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $194.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $190.0 million in the corresponding period in 2024. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year is primarily related to favorable working capital, offset in part by higher cash incentive payments of approximately $36 million related to prior year performance. 

Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology, machinery, equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled $17.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $17.4 million in the corresponding period in 2024.

We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness.

Cash flows used in financing activities are primarily comprised of share repurchases. In accordance with our share repurchase program, we spent $218.7 million and $212.5 million on the repurchase of 170,957 shares and 173,700 shares, during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

(a) The benchmark interest rate is determined by the borrowing currency. The benchmark rates by borrowing currency are as follows: SOFR for U.S. dollars (plus a 10 basis points spread adjustment), SARON for Swiss franc, EURIBOR for Euro and SONIA for Great British pounds.

On May 30, 2024, we entered into a $1.35 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended our $1.25 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement), that is further described in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. 

As of March 31, 2025, approximately $679.8 million of additional borrowings was available under our Credit Agreement, and we maintained $64.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. 

Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flows and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. Further, we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of March 31, 2025.

In January 2025, the Company entered into an agreement to issue and sell EUR 100 million 10 1/2-year Senior Notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.8% (3.8% Euro Senior Notes) in a private placement, which will mature in July 2035. The 3.8% Euro Senior Notes are unsecured obligations

of the Company and the terms are consistent with the previous Notes as disclosed in Note 10 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. 

Other Local Arrangements

In 2018, two of the Company's non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions which include an interest rate of SARON plus 87.5 basis points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2025.

Share Repurchase Program

We have $1.5 billion of remaining availability for our share repurchase program as of March 31, 2025. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings, and cash balances. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors. 

We have purchased 32.5 million common shares at an average price per share of $307.74 since the inception of the program in 2004 through March 31, 2025. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we spent $218.7 million and $212.5 million on the repurchase of 170,957 shares and 173,700 shares at an average price per share of $1,279.54 and $1,223.35, respectively. We reissued 4,282 shares and 4,898 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. In addition, the Company incurred $2.0 million and $2.1 million of excise tax during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, related to the Inflation Reduction Act which is reflected as a reduction in shareholders' equity in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Effect of Currency on Results of Operations

Our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally, and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings decrease. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also decrease. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $2.4 million to $2.7 million annually. 

We also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $2.2 million to $2.5 million annually. 

In addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and euro. Based on our outstanding debt at March 31, 2025, we estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately $47.6 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.
