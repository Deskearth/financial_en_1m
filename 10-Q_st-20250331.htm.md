SENSATA TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING PLC

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited)

1\. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders' equity of Sensata Technologies Holding plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the "Company," "Sensata," "we," "our," or "us." 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, these interim financial statements do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying interim financial information reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the interim period results. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 28, 2025 (the "2024 Annual Report"). 

We present financial information for two reportable segments, Performance Sensing ("PS") and Sensing Solutions ("SS"). Additionally, our business strategy involves leveraging new and emerging technologies, which complement our existing product offerings, and we refer to these trends collectively as “megatrends.” Our operating segments’ performance is primarily evaluated based on segment operating income. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we realigned the definition of segment operating income to include megatrend costs, which were previously excluded from segment operating income and included in corporate and other costs. Prior year amounts in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been recast to reflect this realignment and to conform to current year presentation. Refer to Note 15: Segment Reporting for additional information. 

All U.S. dollar ("USD") and share amounts presented, except per share amounts, are stated in thousands, unless otherwise indicated. Certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to current year presentation.

  

2\. New Accounting Standards

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-09, Income taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 also includes certain other updates to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and should be applied prospectively, with retrospective application also a permitted option. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU No. 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 Income Statement (Topic 220): Reporting Comprehensive Income, which requires additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement as well as disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented in the income statement. ASU No. 2024-03 does not change or remove current expense presentation requirements within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the update requires disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, of disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU No. 2024-03 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

5\. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net

2H 2024 Plan

In the year ended December 31, 2024, we committed to a plan to reorganize our business (the “2H 2024 Plan”). The 2H 2024 Plan, consisting of involuntary reductions-in-force, site closures, and other cost-savings initiatives, was commenced to adjust our cost structure and business activities to better align with weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty in many of our end markets and to take active measures to accelerate our margin recovery.

The reductions-in-force, which are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which the actions were executed or planned, are expected to impact approximately 240 positions. Over the life of the 2H 2024 Plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of between $14.2 million and $16.0 million, primarily related to reductions-in-force. The majority of the actions under the 2H 2024 Plan are expected to be completed on or before December 31, 2025. We expect to settle these charges with cash on hand.

Q3 2023 Plan

In the year ended December 31, 2023, we committed to a plan to reorganize our business (the “Q3 2023 Plan”). The Q3 2023 Plan, consisting of voluntary and involuntary reductions-in-force, site closures, and other cost-savings initiatives, was commenced to adjust our cost structure and business activities.

The reductions-in-force, which are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which the actions were executed or planned, impacted 505 positions. Over the life of the Q3 2023 Plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of between $24.8 million and $25.8 million, primarily related to reductions-in-force. The majority of the actions under the Q3 2023 Plan are expected to be completed on or before December 31, 2025. We expect to settle these charges with cash on hand.

Net income and net income per share are presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Certain potential ordinary shares were excluded from our calculation of diluted weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding because either they would have had an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share or they related to equity awards that were contingently issuable for which the contingency had not been satisfied. These potential ordinary shares were as follows:

Our indebtedness as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 consists of various tranches of senior unsecured notes as shown in the table above. We also have secured credit facilities (the "Senior Secured Credit Facilities") which provide for our $750.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and incremental availability under which additional debt can be issued. Refer to Note 14: Debt of our 2024 Annual Report for additional information related to our indebtedness.

Revolving Credit Facility

As of March 31, 2025, we had $745.8 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $4.2 million of obligations in respect of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder. Outstanding letters of credit are issued primarily for the benefit of certain operating activities. As of March 31, 2025, no amounts had been drawn against these outstanding letters of credit.

Accrued Interest

Accrued interest associated with our outstanding debt is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, accrued interest totaled $34.1 million and $55.2 million, respectively.

11\. Commitments and Contingencies 

We are regularly involved in a number of claims and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters, based upon our experience and current information known to us, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

12\. Shareholders' Equity

Purchase of noncontrolling interest in joint venture

In February 2024, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in our joint venture with Dongguan Churod Electronics Co., Ltd. for approximately $79.4 million. Prior to the transaction, we had been consolidating the joint venture. The purchase of the 50% non-controlling interest was accounted for as an equity transaction. No gain or loss was recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the amount by which the non-controlling interest was adjusted was recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital recorded in equity.

Cash Dividends

In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we paid aggregate cash dividends of $17.9 million and $18.1 million, respectively. On April 21, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on May 28, 2025 to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2025.

Treasury Shares 

From time to time, our Board of Directors has authorized various share repurchase programs, which may be modified or terminated by the Board at any time. Under these programs, we may repurchase ordinary shares at such times and in amounts to be determined by our management, based on market conditions, legal requirements, and other corporate considerations, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, provided that such transactions were completed pursuant to an agreement and with a third party approved by our shareholders at the annual general meeting. Ordinary shares repurchased by us are recognized, measured at cost, and presented as treasury shares on our consolidated balance sheets, resulting in a reduction of shareholders' equity. In September 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500.0 million ordinary share repurchase program (the “September 2023 Program”), which became effective on October 1, 2023.

In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 3.5 million and 0.3 million ordinary shares, respectively, for $100.5 million and $10.1 million, respectively. All share repurchases in the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were made under the September 2023 Program. As of March 31, 2025, $302.5 million remained available for repurchase under the September 2023 Program.

___________________________________

(1) Excluding any related debt discounts, premiums, and deferred financing costs.

In addition to the above, we hold certain equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values for which we use the measurement alternative prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 321. Such investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we held equity investments under the measurement alternative of $7.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively, which are presented in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, we adjusted the carrying value of one of these equity investments as a result of an observable price change, resulting in a loss of $14.8 million.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features 

We have agreements with our derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if we default on our indebtedness and repayment of the indebtedness has been accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations.

As of March 31, 2025, the termination value of outstanding derivatives in a liability position, excluding any adjustment for non-performance risk, was $25.3 million. As of March 31, 2025, we had not posted any cash collateral related to these agreements. If we breach any of the default provisions on any of our indebtedness as described above, we could be required to settle our obligations under the derivative agreements at their termination values.

15\. Segment Reporting

We present financial information for two reportable segments, Performance Sensing and Sensing Solutions. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we realigned the definition of segment operating income to include megatrend costs, which were

previously excluded from segment operating income and included in corporate and other costs. Refer to Note 1: Basis of Presentation for additional information.

Our operating segments are businesses that we manage as components of an enterprise, for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), who is our chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. 

An operating segment’s performance is primarily evaluated based on segment operating income, which excludes amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, restructuring charges, and certain corporate costs or credits not associated with the operations of the segment, such as share-based compensation expense. Corporate and other costs excluded from an operating (and reportable) segment’s performance are separately stated below and also include costs that are related to functional areas such as finance, information technology, legal, and human resources. The CODM uses operating income primarily in the annual budget and forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis for operating income when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. Significant expenses are reviewed by the CODM on a consolidated basis and not at the operating segment level. We believe that segment operating income, as defined above, is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our segments. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, operating income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The accounting policies of each of our operating and reportable segments are materially consistent with those described in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies of the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2024 Annual Report.

The Performance Sensing segment serves the automotive and HVOR industries through the development and manufacture of sensors, high-voltage solutions (i.e., electrical protection components), and other solutions that are used in mission-critical systems and applications. Examples include those used in subsystems of automobiles, on-road trucks, and off-road equipment, such as tire pressure monitoring, thermal management, electrical protection, regenerative braking, powertrain (engine/transmission), and exhaust management. These products are used in subsystems that, among other things, improve operating performance and efficiency and contribute to environmentally sustainable and safe solutions.

  

The Sensing Solutions segment primarily serves the industrial and aerospace industries through the development and manufacture of a broad portfolio of application-specific sensor and electrical protection products used in a diverse range of industrial markets, including the appliance, HVAC, water management, operator controls, charging infrastructure, renewable energy generation, green hydrogen production, and microgrid applications and markets, as well as the aerospace market, including commercial aircraft, defense, and aftermarket markets.

  

Some of the products and solutions sold by the Sensing Solutions segment include pressure, temperature, and position sensors, motor and compressor protectors, high-voltage contactors, solid state relays, bimetal electromechanical controls, power inverters, charge controllers, battery management systems, operator controls, and power conversion systems. Sensing Solutions products perform many functions, including prevention of damage from excess heat or electrical current, optimization of system performance, low-power circuit control, renewable energy generation, and power conversion from direct current power to alternating current power.

16\. Disposals

Insights Business

In August 2024, we executed a purchase agreement whereby we agreed to sell the Insights Business to an affiliate of Balmoral Funds ("the Buyer"). The closing of the transaction ("Closing") occurred in the third quarter of 2024, at which time net assets transferred to the Buyer. 

Concurrent with the Closing, the parties entered into a Transition Services Agreement ("TSA") and a Supply Agreement. The terms of the TSA require that we provide various forms of commercial, operational, and back-office support to the Buyer. The Supply Agreement commenced at Closing and has a term of five years or less. The terms of this agreement require that we sell certain tire pressure monitoring system products to the Buyer over the term of the agreement. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Insights Business was included in our Other segment. 

Magnetic Speed and Position Business ("MSP Business")

In November 2024, we executed a purchase agreement whereby we agreed to sell the MSP Business to a third party. The closing of the transaction occurred in the first quarter of 2025, at which time net assets transferred to the Buyer.

17\. Subsequent Events

On April 6, 2025, we experienced a ransomware incident that encrypted certain devices in our network. Upon discovery, we immediately activated our response protocols, implemented containment measures, including proactively taking our network offline, and launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity professionals. In coordination with legal counsel, we have notified law enforcement about the matter and are supporting its investigation.

  

The incident temporarily impacted our operations, including shipping, receiving, manufacturing production, and various other support functions to varying degrees over approximately a two-week period. Our ongoing investigation has identified evidence that files were taken from our environment. We are working to identify and review the files involved and will take additional actions as appropriate based on our review, including notifying individuals and regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable law.

  

As of the date of these financial statements, we do not expect this incident to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results and operations for the second quarter ending June 30, 2025 nor the full year ending December 31, 2025; however, the full scope and impact of this incident is not yet known and could result in a future determination that the incident will be material to our financial statements and results of operations.

Net revenue decreased 4.4% on an organic basis, which excludes a decrease of 0.6% attributed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease of 4.5% due primarily to the effects of the divestiture of the Insights business in the third quarter of 2024.

Performance Sensing

Performance Sensing net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025 decreased 8.8% on a reported basis and 7.5% on an organic basis compared to the prior period, which was primarily due to decreases in automotive and HVOR production levels in North America and Europe. 

Sensing Solutions

Sensing Solutions net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased 1.2% on a reported basis and 3.8% on an organic basis compared to the prior period, which is primarily growth in our industrial market.

Cost of revenue

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue increased from the prior period, primarily due to (1) the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, (2) the net impacts of inflation on material and logistics costs and pricing recoveries from customers, and (3) unfavorable product mix. 

Research and development expense

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, research and development expense did not fluctuate materially from the prior year period.

Selling, general and administrative expense

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, SG&A expense did not fluctuate materially from the prior year period.

Amortization of intangible assets

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, amortization of intangible assets decreased from the prior period, primarily due to the divestiture of the Insights Business, resulting in approximately $9.8 million lower amortization expense during fiscal year 2025, and the effect of amortization of intangible assets in accordance with their expected economic benefit, which generally results in acceleration of amortization expense in the early years of the life of an intangible asset. 

Restructuring and other charges, net

In the three months ended March 31, 2025, restructuring and other charges, net increased from the prior year period, primarily due to the loss on the sale of the Magnetic Speed and Positioning business and charges associated with the 2H 2024 Plan.

Refer to Note 5: Restructuring and Other Charges, Net and Note 16: Disposals of the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Report, for additional information regarding the components of restructuring and other charges, net.

Operating income 

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, operating income was $122.2 million, compared to $144.8 million in the prior period. This unfavorable impact was driven primarily by (1) the impact of organic revenue declines and manufacturing efficiencies, (2) the disposition of the Insights business in the third quarter of 2024, and (3) the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by (1) a $17.9 million decrease in amortization of intangibles and (2) cost savings as a result of actions taken as part of the 2H 2024 and Q3 2023 Plans. 

Interest expense

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, interest expense did not fluctuate materially from the prior year period.

Other, net

Other, net primarily includes currency remeasurement gains and losses on net monetary assets, gains and losses on foreign currency and commodity forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, mark-to-market gains and losses on investments, losses related to debt refinancing, and the portion of our net periodic benefit cost excluding service cost. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, other, net represented a net gain of $2.1 million, a favorable impact on earnings of $13.7 million compared to a net loss of $11.5 million in the prior period. This favorable impact was primarily due to the gain on commodity forward contracts and the absence of a $14.8 million loss recognized in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of observable price changes related to an equity investment held using the measurement alternative.

Refer to Note 13: Fair Value Measures and Note 6: Other, Net of the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Report, for additional details of our hedge accounting contracts and the components of other, net, respectively. 

Provision for income taxes 

The provision for income taxes consists of (1) current tax expense, which relates primarily to our profitable operations in tax jurisdictions with limited or no net operating loss carryforwards and withholding taxes related to management fees, royalties, and the repatriation of foreign earnings; and (2) deferred tax expense (or benefit), which represents adjustments in book-to-tax basis differences primarily related to (a) book versus tax basis in intangible assets, (b) changes in net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, and (c) changes in withholding taxes on unremitted earnings. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This section provides additional information regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures, including organic revenue growth (or decline), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share ("EPS"), free cash flow, adjusted corporate and other expenses, net debt, gross and net leverage ratio, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA"), which are used by our management, Board of Directors, and investors. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance, and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. 

The use of our non-GAAP financial measures has limitations. They should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, reported net revenue growth (or decline), operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS, net cash provided by operating activities, corporate and other expenses, or total debt and finance lease obligations, respectively, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our measures of organic revenue growth (or decline), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, free cash flow, adjusted corporate and other expenses, gross and net leverage ratio, and adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as, or comparable to, similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.

Organic revenue growth (or decline) and market outgrowth

Organic revenue growth (or decline) is defined as the reported percentage change in net revenue calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the period-over-period impact of foreign exchange rate differences as well as the net impact of material acquisitions and divestitures and product life-cycle management for the 12-month period following the respective transaction date(s). 

We believe that organic revenue growth (or decline) provides investors with helpful information with respect to our operating performance, and we use organic revenue growth (or decline) to evaluate our ongoing operations as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that organic revenue growth (or decline) provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior-year period.

Market outgrowth is calculated as organic revenue growth less our weighted market growth. Our weighted market growth is calculated using our regional and platform sales mix, as applicable, in the corresponding prior period. Market outgrowth is used to describe the impact of an increasing quantity and value of our products used in customer systems and applications above market growth. We believe this provides a more meaningful comparison of our revenue growth relative to the markets we serve.

Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS

We define adjusted operating income as operating income (or loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted to exclude certain non-GAAP adjustments which are described under the heading Non-GAAP Adjustments below. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income (or loss) by net revenue determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted net income as follows: net income (or loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding certain non-GAAP adjustments which are described under the heading Non-GAAP Adjustments below. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing adjusted net income by the number of diluted weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding in the period as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Management uses adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS (and the constant currency equivalent of each) as measures of operating performance, for planning purposes (including the preparation of our annual operating budget), to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, in communications with our Board of Directors and investors concerning our financial performance, and as factors in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe investors and securities analysts also use these non-GAAP financial measures in their evaluation of our performance and the performance of other similar companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of liquidity. 

Free cash flow

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software. We believe free cash flow is useful to management and investors as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to, among other things, fund acquisitions, repurchase ordinary shares, or accelerate the repayment of debt obligations. 

Adjusted corporate and other expenses

Adjusted corporate and other expenses is defined as corporate and other expenses calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the portion of non-GAAP adjustments described below that relate to corporate and other expenses. We believe adjusted corporate and other expenses is useful to management and investors in understanding the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on operating expenses not allocated to our segments.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (or loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding interest expense, interest income, and provision for (or benefit from) income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and the following non-GAAP adjustments, if applicable: (1) restructuring related and other, (2) financing and other transaction costs, and (3) other, net activities. Refer to Non-GAAP Adjustments below for additional discussion of these adjustments. 

Gross leverage ratio

Gross leverage ratio represents gross debt (total debt and finance lease obligations) divided by last twelve months ("LTM") adjusted EBITDA. We believe that gross leverage ratio is a useful measure to management and investors in understanding trends in our overall financial condition.

Net leverage ratio

Net leverage ratio represents net debt (total debt, finance lease and other financing obligations less cash and cash equivalents) divided by LTM adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the net leverage ratio is a useful measure to management and investors in understanding trends in our overall financial condition.

Non-GAAP adjustments 

Many of our non-GAAP adjustments relate to a series of strategic initiatives developed by our management aimed at better positioning us for future revenue growth and an improved cost structure. These initiatives have been modified from time to time to reflect changes in overall market conditions and the competitive environment facing our business. These initiatives include, among other items, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings of certain business, supply chain or corporate activities, and various financing transactions. We describe these adjustments in more detail below, each of which is net of current tax impacts, as applicable.

  

•Restructuring related and other: includes net charges related to certain restructuring and other exit activities, other costs (or income) that we believe are either unique or unusual to the identified reporting period, and the impact of

commodity forward contacts that we believe impact comparisons to prior period operating results. Such costs include charges related to optimization of our manufacturing processes to increase productivity. This type of activity occurs periodically; however, each action is unique, discrete, and driven by various facts and circumstances. Such amounts are excluded from internal financial statements and analyses that management uses in connection with financial planning and in its review and assessment of our operating and financial performance, including the performance of our segments. 

  

•Financing and other transaction costs: includes costs incurred, such as legal, accounting, and other professional services, that are directly related to an acquisition, divestiture, or equity financing transaction, expenses related to compensation arrangements entered into concurrent with the closing of an acquisition, adjustments related to changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration amounts, and historical adjustments to exclude step-up depreciation in our non-GAAP measures. Beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2024, we discontinued the use of adjustments to exclude step-up depreciation in our non-GAAP measures. Prior periods have not been recast. 

  

•Amortization of intangible assets: includes amortization of intangible assets. Beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2024, we started adjusting operating income and net income to exclude the amortization of all our intangible assets. Prior periods have not been recast. 

  

•Other, net: includes expenses (or income) recorded within Other, net on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Beginning with the three months ended March 31, 2025, we started adjusting net income to exclude the impacts of these losses (or gains). Prior periods have been recast. Refer to Note 6: Other, Net of the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, for additional details of the components of Other, net.

•Deferred taxes and other tax related: includes adjustments for deferred taxes and other timing differences including, but not limited to, book-to-tax basis differences on the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill, the utilization of net operating losses, and adjustments to our valuation allowance in connection with certain transactions and tax law changes. Other tax related items include certain adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits and withholding tax on repatriation of foreign earnings.

•Amortization of debt issuance costs: represents interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs as well as debt discounts, net of premiums.

•Where applicable, the current income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. 

Our definition of adjusted net income excludes the deferred provision for (or benefit from) income taxes and other tax related items described above. As we treat deferred income taxes as an adjustment to compute adjusted net income, the deferred income tax effect associated with the reconciling items presented below would not change adjusted net income for any period presented.

Non-GAAP reconciliations 

The following tables present reconciliations of certain financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the related non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Refer to the Non-GAAP Adjustments section above for additional information regarding these adjustments. Amounts and percentages in the tables below have been calculated based on unrounded numbers, accordingly, certain amounts may not appear to recalculate due to the effect of rounding.

(c) In the three months ended December 31, 2024, we discontinued the use of adjustments to exclude step-up depreciation in our non-GAAP measures and we adjusted operating income and net income to exclude the amortization of all our intangible assets. The three months ended March 31, 2024 have not been recast. If we had recast this non-GAAP measure for the three months ended March 31, 2024, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income would have increased by an additional $1.1 million.

The amount of cash and cash equivalents held in these geographic regions fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, such as our use of intercompany loans and dividends and the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. Our earnings are not considered to be permanently reinvested in certain jurisdictions in which they were earned. We recognize a deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings to the extent the remittance of such earnings cannot be recovered in a tax-free manner. 

In certain jurisdictions, our cash balances are subject to withholding taxes immediately upon withdrawal of funds to a different jurisdiction. In addition, in order to take advantage of incentive programs offered by various jurisdictions, including tax incentives, we are required to maintain minimum cash balances in these jurisdictions. The transfer of cash from these jurisdictions could result in loss of incentives or higher cash tax expense, but those impacts are not expected to be material.

Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily due to favorable changes in working capital, partially offset by lower cash provided by earnings. 

Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $6.9 million compared to a use of cash of $42.1 million for the corresponding period of the prior year. This change was primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures and proceeds received from the sale of the MSP Business. Refer to Note 16: Disposals for additional information. For fiscal year 2025, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $150.0 million, which we expect to fund with cash on hand.

Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the amount of cash paid to repurchase ordinary shares, partially offset by the payment of $79.4 million to repurchase the remaining equity interest in a joint venture in the prior year. Refer to Note 12: Shareholders' Equity for additional information.

Indebtedness and Liquidity

As of March 31, 2025, we had $3.2 billion in gross indebtedness, which includes finance lease obligations and excludes debt discounts, premiums, and deferred financing costs. 

Capital Resources

Sources of liquidity

Our sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and available capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2025, we had $745.8 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $4.2 million of obligations in respect of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder. Outstanding letters of credit are issued primarily for the benefit of certain operating activities. As of March 31, 2025, no amounts had been drawn against these outstanding letters of credit. This Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature under which maximum borrowings may be increased under certain circumstances. 

We believe, based on our current level of operations and taking into consideration the restrictions and covenants included in the Credit Agreement, Revolving Credit Facility, and Senior Notes Indentures, that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures, dividend payments, ordinary share repurchases, and debt service for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot make assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Further, our highly-leveraged nature may limit our ability to procure additional financing in the future. 

Our ability to raise additional financing, and our borrowing costs, may be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of April 25, 2025, Moody’s Investors Service’s corporate credit rating for STBV was Ba2 with a positive outlook, and Standard & Poor’s corporate credit rating for STBV was BB+ with a stable outlook. Any future downgrades to STBV's credit ratings may increase our future borrowing costs but will not reduce availability under the Credit Agreement.

Restrictions and Covenants

The Credit Agreement provides that if our senior secured net leverage ratio exceeds a specified level, we are required to use a portion of our excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement, generated by operating, investing, or financing activities to prepay some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments of the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities upon certain asset dispositions and casualty events, in each case subject to certain reinvestment rights, and upon the incurrence of certain indebtedness (excluding any permitted indebtedness). These provisions were not triggered during the three months ended March 31, 2025. 

The Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes Indentures contain restrictions and covenants that limit the ability of our wholly-owned subsidiary, STBV, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur subsequent indebtedness, sell assets, pay dividends, and make other restricted payments. For a full discussion of these restrictions and covenants, refer to Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources included in our 2024 Annual Report. These restrictions and covenants, which are subject to important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes Indentures, were taken into consideration when we established our share repurchase programs and will be evaluated periodically with respect to future potential funding of those programs. As of March 31, 2025, we believe we were in compliance with all covenants and default provisions under our credit arrangements.

Share repurchase programs

From time to time, our Board of Directors has authorized various share repurchase programs, which may be modified or terminated by our Board at any time. We currently have authorization for the September 2023 Program, under which approximately $302.5 million remained available as of March 31, 2025. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, we repurchased 3.5 million and 0.3 million ordinary shares under the September 2023 Program.

Dividends

In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we paid aggregate cash dividends of $17.9 million and $18.1 million, respectively. On April 21, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on May 28, 2025 to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2025.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

For a discussion of the critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management, refer to Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in our 2024 Annual Report. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to exercise judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. It also requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. No material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates, as previously disclosed, have occurred during the first three months of 2025.

Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

No significant changes to our market risk have occurred since December 31, 2024. For a discussion of market risks affecting us, refer to Part II, Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our 2024 Annual Report. 

Item 4.Controls and Procedures.

The required certifications of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer are included as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The disclosures set forth in this Item 4 contain information concerning the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and changes in internal control over financial reporting referred to in these certifications. These certifications should be read in conjunction with this Item 4 for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by the certifications.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level because of the existence of material weaknesses as described below. As of December 31, 2024, the Company identified material weaknesses in maintaining an appropriate internal control environment. The Company did not specify objectives with sufficient clarity to enable an appropriate level of risk assessment and monitoring. Additionally, the Company's control activities did not adequately and consistently establish policies, procedures, information protocols and communications to design and operate effective controls, due in part, to a lack of appropriate accounting personnel, impacting areas such as inventory and account reconciliation processes in our Americas Accounting and Shared Services teams located in Mexico.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Although these material weaknesses did not result in a material misstatement to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, they have been identified as material weaknesses because there is a possibility that they could lead to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Material Weakness Remediation Plan

We have devoted a significant amount of time and resources towards remediation of the material weaknesses. We will continue to execute on our remediation plan until the material weaknesses are remediated. Actions taken to date, and expected to be taken, include the following: 

•Completion of an internal organizational assessment to identify gaps in knowledge and staffing levels and consider potential reorganization of our teams.

•Hiring of additional accounting and IT personnel, including a new Chief Accounting Officer in May 2024, with the appropriate level of knowledge, training, and experience to improve our internal control over financial reporting and IT capabilities. We continue to recruit for additional resources.

•Engaged a third party to assist in development and formalization of a risk assessment process across the organization to identify risks and design new controls or enhance existing controls responsive to such risks to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting based on criteria established in the COSO framework. We are in various stages of this risk assessment process and control development process, including assessing and documenting control gaps and remediating existing control gaps.

•Implemented a global system to enhance our account reconciliation process, increase monitoring capabilities, and improve our consistency.

•Assessed the specific training needs for newly hired and existing personnel and developed and delivered training programs designed to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting.

•Enhanced the procedures regarding our annual physical inventory counts, including employee training in performing annual physical counts and clarification of instructions as to the process for recording adjustments to inventory as a result of physical counts. We have completed physical inventories at all of our locations.

We are committed to the remediation of these material weaknesses and expect to successfully implement enhanced control processes. However, as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal controls over financial reporting are subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may be inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
