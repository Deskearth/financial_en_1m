(unaudited)

1\. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company

IQVIA Holdings Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “IQVIA”) is a leading global provider of clinical research services, commercial insights and healthcare intelligence to the life sciences and healthcare industries. With approximately 89,000 employees, the Company conducts business in more than 100 countries. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Information

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations have been included. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2025. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company, but does not include all the disclosures required by GAAP.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Accounting pronouncements recently adopted

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements. The new guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. It does not change the definition of a segment or the guidance for determining reportable segments. The new guidance was effective for the Company in the annual period beginning January 1, 2024, and in 2025 for interim periods. The adoption of this new accounting guidance for the annual period beginning January 1, 2024, and for the three months ended March 31, 2025, did not have a material effect on the Company's disclosures within the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting pronouncements issued but not adopted as of March 31, 2025

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require additional disclosures about income taxes, primarily focused on the disclosure of income taxes paid and the rate reconciliation table. The new guidance is effective for the Company in the annual period beginning January 1, 2025. The Company is assessing the impacts of this ASU on its disclosures within the consolidated financial statements.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (DISE), to improve the disclosures about an entity's expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The new guidance requires additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods, and will be effective for the Company in the annual period beginning January 1, 2027, and interim periods beginning January 1, 2028. The Company is assessing the impacts of this ASU on its disclosures within the consolidated financial statements.

No individual customer represented 10% or more of consolidated revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 or 2024.

Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations

As of March 31, 2025, approximately $34.9 billion of revenues are expected to be recognized in the future from remaining performance obligations. The Company expects to recognize revenues on approximately 30% of these remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months, on approximately 85% over the next five years, with the balance recognized thereafter. Most of the Company's remaining performance obligations where revenues are expected to be recognized beyond the next twelve months are for service contracts for clinical research in the Company's Research & Development Solutions segment. The customer contract transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations differs from backlog in that it does not include wholly unperformed contracts under which the customer has a unilateral right to cancel the arrangement.

3\. Trade Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services and Unearned Income

Trade accounts receivables and unbilled services consist of the following:

Unbilled services and unearned income were as follows:

Unbilled services    $               1,896                              $       1,856           $  40       
Unearned income      (1,940)                                   (1,779)                 (161)    
Net balance          $               (44)                               $       77              $  (121)    

Unbilled services, which is comprised of approximately 69% of unbilled receivables and 31% of contract assets as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, increased by $40 million as compared to December 31, 2024. Contract assets are unbilled services for which invoicing is based on the timing of certain milestones related to service contracts for clinical research whereas unbilled receivables are billable upon the passage of time. Unearned income increased by $161 million over the same period resulting in a decrease of $121 million in the net balance of unbilled services and unearned income between March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The change in the net balance is driven by the difference in timing of revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, primarily related to the Company’s Research & Development Solutions contracts (which is based on the percentage of costs incurred) versus the timing of invoicing, which is based on certain milestones.

The majority of the unearned income balance as of the beginning of the year is expected to be recognized in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2025.

Bad debt expense recognized on the Company’s trade accounts receivable was immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. 

Accounts Receivable Factoring Arrangements

The Company has accounts receivable factoring agreements to sell certain eligible unsecured trade accounts receivable, either based on automatic arrangements or at its option, without recourse, to unrelated third-party financial institutions for cash.

The Company expects approximately $7 million of pre-tax unrealized gains related to its foreign exchange contracts and interest rate derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (“AOCI”) as of March 31, 2025 to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the total amount, net of income taxes, of the cash flow hedge effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income was $(1) million and $9 million, respectively. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company terminated its existing cross-currency swap agreements and entered into new cross-currency swap agreements for the same purpose and with substantially similar terms as the previous swaps. The new $1,250 million swaps expire in February 2029 at the time of the senior secured notes to which they are related, and the Company will receive semiannual interest payments on February 1 and August 1 from the counterparties based on a fixed interest rate until maturity of these agreements. The new $1,485 million swaps expire in January 2031 at the time of the term loans to which they are related, and the Company will receive quarterly interest payments from the counterparties based on a fixed interest rate until maturity of these agreements. The notional amount of these swaps will decrease over time in connection with the related term loans. The Company designated these new swap agreements as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. 

As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's cross-currency swaps were designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded a $(133) million loss and $56 million gain, respectively, within AOCI as a result of these cross-currency swaps. The Company recognized approximately $12 million and $9 million related to the excluded component as a reduction of interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

As of March 31, 2025, the portion of the Company's foreign currency denominated debt balance (net of original issue discount) designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled €2,554 million ($2,764 million). The amount of foreign exchange (losses) gains related to the net investment hedge included in the cumulative translation adjustment component of AOCI for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was $(144) million and $68 million, respectively.

6\. Fair Value Measurements 

The Company records certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value is described below. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their fair values as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 due to their short-term nature. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of total debt was $14,276 million and $13,966 million, respectively, as determined under Level 2 measurements for these financial instruments.

Below is a summary of the valuation techniques used in determining fair value:

Marketable securities — The Company values trading and available-for-sale securities using the quoted market value of the securities held.

Derivatives — Derivatives consist of foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is based on observable market inputs of spot and forward rates or using other observable inputs. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate such agreements, taking into account market interest rates and the remaining time to maturities or using market inputs with mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for bid-ask spread. The fair value of the cross-currency swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate such agreements, taking into account the effective interest rates, foreign exchange rates and the remaining time to maturities.

Contingent consideration — The Company values contingent consideration related to business combinations using a weighted probability calculation of potential payment scenarios discounted at rates reflective of the risks associated with the expected future cash flows. Assumptions used to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration include various financial metrics (revenues performance targets and operating forecasts) and the probability of achieving the specific targets. Based on the assessments of the probability of achieving specific targets, as of March 31, 2025 the Company has accrued approximately 84% of the maximum contingent consideration payments that could potentially become payable.

The following table summarizes the changes in Level 3 financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis for the three months ended March 31, 2025:

The current portion of contingent consideration is included within accrued expenses and the long-term portion is included within other liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Revaluations of contingent consideration are recognized in other expense, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. A change in significant unobservable inputs could result in a higher or lower fair value measurement of contingent consideration.

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements 

As of March 31, 2025, assets carried on the balance sheet and not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis totaled $19,882 million and were identified as Level 3. These assets are comprised of debt investments and cost and equity method investments of $352 million, goodwill of $15,027 million and other identifiable intangibles, net of $4,503 million.

Senior Secured Credit Facilities

On March 10, 2025, the Company entered into an Amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among IQVIA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company, IQVIA RDS Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, the other guarantors party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and as collateral agent, and the Lenders (as defined therein) party thereto. The Amendment, among other changes, established a new incremental Term B-5 dollar loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $1,985 million (the “Incremental Term B-5 Dollar Facility”). Proceeds of the Incremental Term B-5 Dollar Facility were applied to (a) refinance the existing Term B-4 dollar loans and (b) repay in full the existing Term B-2 Euro loans. The interest rates for borrowings under the Incremental Term B-5 Dollar Facility are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% per annum. In connection with this Amendment, we recognized a $4 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which includes fees and related expenses.

As of March 31, 2025, the Company’s Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provided financing through several senior secured credit facilities of up to $6,511 million, which consisted of $5,616 million principal amounts of debt outstanding (as detailed in the table above), and $895 million of available borrowing capacity on the $2,000 million revolving credit facility and standby letters of credit. The revolving credit facility is comprised of a $1,175 million senior secured revolving facility available in U.S. dollars, a $600 million senior secured revolving facility available in U.S. dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs and other foreign currencies, and a $225 million senior secured revolving facility available in U.S. dollars and Yen.

Restrictive Covenants

The Company’s debt agreements provide for certain covenants and events of default customary for similar instruments, including a covenant not to exceed a specified ratio of consolidated senior secured net indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the senior secured credit facility agreement and a covenant to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio. If an event of default occurs under any of the Company’s or the Company’s subsidiaries’ financing arrangements, the creditors under such financing arrangements will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under such arrangements, and in the case of the lenders under the revolving credit facility and term loans, other actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. The Company’s long-term debt arrangements contain other usual and customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, place limitations on the Company’s ability to declare dividends. As of March 31, 2025, the Company was in compliance in all material respects with the financial covenants under the Company’s financing arrangements.

8\. Contingencies 

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. For those matters where management currently believes it is probable that the Company will incur a loss and that the probable loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded an accrual in the consolidated financial statements based on its best estimates of such loss. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to either the probable outcome or the amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any.

However, even in many instances where the Company has recorded an estimated liability, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the final outcome of the matter or whether resolution of the matter will materially affect the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly.

The Company routinely enters into agreements with third parties, including its clients and suppliers, all in the normal course of business. In these agreements, the Company sometimes agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other party for any damages such other party may suffer as a result of potential intellectual property infringement and other claims. The Company has not accrued a liability with respect to these matters generally, as the exposure is considered remote.

Based on its review of the latest information available, management does not expect the impact of pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against the Company could have a material adverse effect for the period in which it is resolved. The following is a summary of certain legal matters involving the Company.

On January 10, 2017, Quintiles IMS Health Incorporated and IMS Software Services Ltd. (collectively “IQVIA Parties”), filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Veeva Systems, Inc. (“Veeva”) alleging Veeva unlawfully used IQVIA Parties intellectual property to improve Veeva data offerings, to promote and market Veeva data offerings and to improve Veeva technology offerings. IQVIA Parties seek injunctive relief, appointment of a monitor, the award of compensatory and punitive damages and reimbursement of all litigation expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. On March 13, 2017, Veeva filed counterclaims alleging anticompetitive business practices in violation of the Sherman Act and state laws. Veeva claims damages in excess of $200 million, and is seeking punitive damages and litigation costs, including attorneys’ fees. The Company believes the counterclaims are without merit, rejects all counterclaims raised by Veeva and intends to vigorously defend IQVIA Parties’ position and pursue its claims against Veeva. Since the initial filings, the parties have filed additional litigations against each other, primarily concerning the use of IQVIA data with various other Veeva products. Trial has been continued from an early 2025 setting to a date to be determined by the Court.

On May 7, 2021, the Court issued an order and opinion (the “Order”) in which it found significant evidence that Veeva had (1) misappropriated IQVIA data and unlawfully used it to improve Veeva data offerings, (2) engaged in a cover-up by deleting significant evidence of its theft of IQVIA’s trade secrets, and (3) improperly withheld certain evidence under privilege in furtherance of a crime and/or fraud against IQVIA. The Court imposed five sanctions against Veeva, including ordering three separate adverse inference instructions be issued to the jury and that IQVIA be permitted to present evidence to the jury of Veeva’s destruction efforts. Veeva appealed the Order. On March 30, 2024, the Court denied Veeva’s appeal with regard to its rejected privilege claims, while reserving ruling on the appropriate sanctions to be imposed for a later time.

9\. Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 1.0 million shares of preferred stock, $0.01 per share par value. No shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding as of March 31, 2025 or December 31, 2024.

Equity Repurchase Program

On February 5, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors increased the stock repurchase authorization under the Company's equity repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program") with respect to the repurchase of the Company's common stock by an additional $2,000 million, which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the Repurchase Program to $13,725 million. The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for $425 million under the Repurchase Program. These amounts include 0.3 million of shares valued at $50 million, which were accrued for as of March 31, 2025 based on when the trade and settlement dates occurred. As of March 31, 2025, inclusive of the accrued amounts, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $2,588 million of its common stock under the Repurchase Program. In addition, from time to time, the Company has repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the Repurchase Program.

10\. Business Combinations

The Company completed individually and in the aggregate immaterial acquisitions during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Additionally, during the quarter the Company gained a controlling interest in, and therefore consolidated, an entity in which it previously held an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. The fair value of the net assets acquired through this step acquisition are included in the totals presented below, and the related fair value of noncontrolling interests of $8 million is reflected within the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company’s assessment of fair value, including the valuation of certain identified intangibles, and the purchase price allocation related to these acquisitions is preliminary and subject to change upon completion. Further adjustments, largely related to acquired intangible assets and related deferred taxes, may be necessary as additional information related to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is assessed during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The Company recorded goodwill from these acquisitions, primarily attributable to assembled workforce, expected synergies and new customer relationships. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquisitions subsequent to their respective closing dates. Pro forma information is not presented as pro forma results of operations would not be materially different to the actual results of operations of the Company.

11\. Restructuring

The Company has continued to take restructuring actions in 2025 to align its resources and reduce overcapacity to adapt to changing market conditions and integrate acquisitions. These actions include consolidating functional activities, eliminating redundant positions, and aligning resources with customer requirements. These restructuring actions are expected to continue throughout 2025 and into 2026. 

The following amounts were recorded for the restructuring plans:

The reversals were due to changes in estimates primarily resulting from the redeployment of staff and higher than expected voluntary terminations. Restructuring costs are not allocated to the Company’s reportable segments as they are not part of the segment performance measures regularly reviewed by management. The Company expects that the majority of the restructuring accruals as of March 31, 2025 will be paid in 2025 and 2026.

12\. Income Taxes

The Company's effective income tax rate was 18.9% and 14.4% in the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2025 and 2024 was favorably impacted due to changes in the geographical mix of earnings amongst the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2024 was also favorably impacted by $9 million, as a result of excess tax benefits recognized upon settlement of share-based compensation awards. The effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2025 was unfavorably impacted by $3 million of tax expense recognized upon settlement of share-based compensation awards. 

On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% on companies with revenues of at least €750 million, which went into effect in 2024. The Company has continued to evaluate the effect of this through the first quarter of 2025 and determined that it did not have any material impacts for the current year. The Company will continue to assess the impact of this proposal as countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD's proposal.

14\. Segments

The following table presents the Company’s operations by reportable segment. The Company is managed through three reportable segments, Technology & Analytics Solutions, Research & Development Solutions and Contract Sales & Medical Solutions. Technology & Analytics Solutions provides mission critical information, technology solutions and real world insights and services to the Company’s life science clients. Research & Development Solutions, which primarily serves biopharmaceutical customers, provides outsourced clinical research and clinical trial related services. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions provides health care provider (including contract sales) and patient engagement services to both biopharmaceutical customers and the broader healthcare market. 

Certain costs are not allocated to the Company's segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses. These costs primarily consist of stock-based compensation and expenses related to integration activities and acquisitions, as well as certain general corporate and unallocated expenses. The Company also does not allocate restructuring costs, depreciation and amortization or impairment charges, if any, to its segments. Asset information by segment is not presented, as this measure is not used by the chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), to assess the Company’s performance.

Table of contents

For all segments, the CODM uses segment revenue and segment profit in the annual budgeting and forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances on a monthly and quarterly basis for both segment revenue and profit when making decisions about allocating operating and capital resources to the segments. The CODM also uses segment revenue and profit to assess the performance for each segment by comparing the results of each segment with one another and in determining the compensation of certain employees.

The Company’s reportable segment information is presented below:

Stock-based awards will have a dilutive effect under the treasury method when the respective period's average market value of the Company's common stock exceeds the exercise proceeds. Performance awards are included in diluted earnings per share based on if the performance targets have been met at the end of the reporting period. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the weighted average number of outstanding stock-based awards not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they are subject to performance conditions that have not been met at the end of the reporting period or the effect of including such stock-based awards in the computation would be anti-dilutive was 2.2 million and 0.8 million, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation 

In the first three months of 2025, approximately 30% of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which represents approximately 60 currencies. Because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and our financial statements are reported in United States dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into United States dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into United States dollars for purposes of reporting our condensed consolidated results. As a result, we believe that reporting results of operations that exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period to period comparisons. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results. As such, the differences noted below between reported results of operations and constant currency information is wholly attributable to the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations.

Consolidated Results of Operations 

For information regarding our results of operations for Technology & Analytics Solutions, Research & Development Solutions and Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, refer to “Segment Results of Operations” later in this section.

The restructuring costs incurred during 2025 and 2024 were due to ongoing efforts to streamline our global operations and reduce overcapacity to adapt to changing market conditions and integrate acquisitions. These restructuring actions are expected to occur throughout 2025 and into 2026 and are expected to consist of consolidating functional activities, eliminating redundant positions and aligning resources with customer requirements.

Interest income includes interest received primarily from bank balances and investments. 

Interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2025, decreased compared to the same period in 2024 as a result of lower base rate interest costs across the floating rate debt portfolio.

Other Expense, Net

Our effective income tax rate was 18.9% and 14.4% in the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2025 and 2024 was favorably impacted due to changes in the geographical mix of earnings amongst the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2024 was also favorably impacted by $9 million, as a result of excess tax benefits recognized upon settlement of share-based compensation awards. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2025 was unfavorably impacted by $3 million of tax expense recognized upon settlement of share-based compensation awards.

On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% on companies with revenues of at least €750 million, which went into effect in 2024. We have continued to evaluate the effect of this through the first quarter of 2025 and determined that it did not have any material impacts for the current year. We will continue to assess the impact of this proposal as countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD's proposal.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements, equity repurchases, adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities, and access to the capital markets. 

27

Table of contents

We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost-effective basis. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. We have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the United States and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so.

We had a cash balance of $1,740 million as of March 31, 2025 ($617 million of which was in the United States), an increase from $1,702 million as of December 31, 2024.

Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. We regularly evaluate our debt arrangements, as well as market conditions, and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates. We may use our existing cash, cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses and/or proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations, to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also continually evaluate new acquisition, expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities, as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses, as appropriate, including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets. Should we elect to pursue any such transaction, we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities. Our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all.

Equity Repurchase Program

On February 5, 2025, our Board of Directors increased the stock repurchase authorization under our equity repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program") with respect to the repurchase of our common stock by an additional $2,000 million, which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the Repurchase Program to $13,725 million. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock for $425 million under the Repurchase Program. These amounts include 0.3 million of shares valued at $50 million, which were accrued for as of March 31, 2025, based on when the trade and settlement dates occurred. As of March 31, 2025, inclusive of the accrued amounts, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $2,588 million of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. In addition, from time to time, we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the Repurchase Program. 

Debt

As of March 31, 2025, we had $14,389 million of total indebtedness, excluding $895 million of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our long-term debt arrangements contain customary restrictive covenants and, as of March 31, 2025, we believe we were in compliance with our restrictive covenants in all material respects.

Senior Secured Credit Facilities

On March 10, 2025, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Amendment, among other changes, established a new incremental Term B-5 dollar loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $1,985 million (the “Incremental Term B-5 Dollar Facility”). Proceeds of the Incremental Term B-5 Dollar Facility were applied to refinance our existing Term B-4 dollar loans and repay in full our existing Term B-2 Euro loans. In connection with this Amendment, we recognized a $4 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which includes fees and related expenses.

As of March 31, 2025, our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provided financing through the senior secured credit facilities of up to $6,511 million, which consisted of $5,616 million principal amounts of debt outstanding, and $895 million of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility and standby letters of credit. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding our credit arrangements.

Receivables Financing Facility

As of March 31, 2025, no additional amounts of revolving loans were available under the receivables financing facility.

Net cash provided by operating activities    $                             568          $  522    

Cash provided by operating activities increased $46 million during the first three months of 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was due to an increase in cash from accounts receivable and unbilled services ($73 million) and from cash-related net income ($26 million), offset by a decrease in cash from other operating assets and liabilities ($43 million), which includes $42 million in cash received related to the termination of our previous cross-currency swaps during the first three months of 2025, and unearned income ($10 million). 

Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities    $                             (305)          $  (314)    

Cash used in investing activities decreased $9 million during the first three months of 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by less cash used for investments in unconsolidated affiliates, net ($11 million), acquisitions of businesses ($8 million), acquisitions of property, equipment and software ($3 million), sales (purchases) of marketable securities, net ($3 million), and cash from other ($1 million), offset by more cash used in investments in debt and equity securities ($17 million).

Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities    $                             (258)          $  (106)    

Cash used in financing activities increased $152 million during the first three months of 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to more cash payments on debt and principal payments on finance leases ($2,053 million), repurchase of common stock ($375 million), and payments for contingent consideration and deferred purchase price accruals ($3 million), offset by more proceeds from issuance of debt, net ($1,979 million), revolving credit facilities, net of repayments ($275 million), and less cash used for payments related to employee stock incentive plans ($25 million).

a.any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by merger, amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise) of (i) the capital stock of such Guarantor, after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor, in each case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture;

b.the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of indebtedness under the senior secured term loan facilities and the senior secured revolving credit facilities under that certain Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the release or discharge of such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except, in each case, a discharge or release by or as a result of payment of such Indebtedness or under such guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release, and that if any such guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to Section 4.11 of the Indenture);

c.the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

On October 30, 2013, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved an equity repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to $125 million of our common stock. The Board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the Repurchase Program with respect to the repurchase of our common stock by $600 million, $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.0 billion in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2023, respectively. On February 5, 2025, the Board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the Repurchase Program with respect to the repurchase of the Company's common stock by an additional $2,000 million, which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the Repurchase Program to $13,725 million. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. The timing and amount of repurchases are determined by our management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of our common stock, our corporate requirements, and overall market conditions. Purchases of our common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or in privately negotiated transactions. The Repurchase Program for common stock does not have an expiration date. In addition, from time to time, we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the Repurchase Program.

From inception of the Repurchase Program through March 31, 2025, we have repurchased a total of $11,137 million of our securities under the Repurchase Program.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock for $425 million under the Repurchase Program. These amounts include 0.3 million of shares valued at $50 million, which were accrued for as of March 31, 2025 based on when the trade and settlement dates occurred. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding the Repurchase Program.

As of March 31, 2025, inclusive of the accrued amounts, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $2,588 million of our common stock under the Repurchase Program.

Table of contents

Since the merger between Quintiles and IMS Health, inclusive of accrued amounts, we have repurchased 86.9 million shares of our common stock at an average market price per share of $123.86 for an aggregate purchase price of $10,763 million both under and outside of the Repurchase Program. This includes shares withheld from employees to satisfy certain tax obligations due in connection with grants of stock under the IQVIA Holdings Inc. 2017 Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations. It does not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose. The shares of common stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations may be deemed to be “issuer purchases” of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item.

The following table summarizes the monthly equity repurchase program activity for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to the Repurchase Program.
