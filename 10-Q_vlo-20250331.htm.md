These interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these interim unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of our results for the interim period presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. Operating results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2025. These interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

  

The balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 has been derived from our audited financial statements as of that date. For further information, refer to our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

  

Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these interim unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

  

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

ASU 2023-07

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, to improve interim and annual disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and other segment related items. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2024 and it did not affect our financial position or our results of operations, but did result in additional disclosures.

ASU 2023-09

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, to improve annual income tax disclosures by requiring further disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This ASU

also includes certain other amendments intended to improve the effectiveness of annual income tax disclosures. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2025 and it did not affect our financial position or our results of operations, but will result in additional annual disclosures.

  

Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted

ASU 2024-03

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting—Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, to improve interim and annual disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses by requiring more detailed information in the notes to the financial statements about certain expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and selling expenses. We expect to adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2027 and the adoption will not affect our financial position or our results of operations, but will result in additional disclosures.

  

2\. IMPAIRMENT

  

In recent years, the State of California adopted legislation that has subjected our refining and marketing operations to potential increased operational restrictions and new reporting requirements. The considerable uncertainty and potential adverse effects on our operations and financial performance resulted in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for our operations in California.

  

In late March 2025, we approved a plan with respect to the operations at our Benicia Refinery and currently intend to cease refining operations by the end of April 2026. In addition, we considered strategic alternatives for our remaining operations in California. As a result, we updated our evaluation of potential impairment and concluded that the carrying values of our Benicia and Wilmington refineries were not recoverable as of March 31, 2025. Therefore, we reduced the carrying values of these assets to their estimated fair values and recognized a combined asset impairment loss of $1.1 billion in our Refining segment in the three months ended March 31, 2025. See Note 11 for disclosure related to the method used to determine the fair values.

  

Included in the recoverability assessments discussed above was the recognition of expected asset retirement obligations of $337 million, which primarily reflects the fair value of estimated costs for certain legal obligations to decommission the assets based on a range of potential settlement dates.

  

In addition, we shortened the estimated useful life of the Benicia Refinery to reflect the plan to cease use of the refining assets by the end of April 2026. Therefore, the revised carrying value of the net property, plant, and equipment and other noncurrent assets of $722 million will be depreciated to the estimated salvage value of $107 million beginning April 2025 through April 2026. Furthermore, we continue to evaluate strategic alternatives for our remaining operations in California.

6\. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

  

Consolidated VIEs

We consolidate a VIE when we have a variable interest in an entity for which we are the primary beneficiary. As of March 31, 2025, the significant consolidated VIEs included:

  

•DGD, a joint venture with a subsidiary of Darling Ingredients Inc. that owns and operates two plants that process waste and renewable feedstocks (predominantly animal fats, used cooking oils, vegetable oils, and inedible distillers corn oils (DCOs)) into renewable diesel, renewable naphtha, and neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)1; and

  

•Central Mexico Terminals, a collective group of three subsidiaries of Infraestructura Energetica Nova, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (IEnova), which is a Mexican company and indirect subsidiary of Sempra Energy, a U.S. public company. We have terminaling agreements with Central Mexico Terminals that represent variable interests. We do not have an ownership interest in Central Mexico Terminals.

  

The assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle their own obligations and the creditors of the consolidated VIEs have no recourse to our other assets. We generally do not provide financial guarantees to the VIEs. Although we have provided credit facilities to some of the VIEs in support of their construction or acquisition activities and working capital requirements, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are impacted by the performance of the consolidated VIEs, net of intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in each VIE.

  

The following tables present summarized balance sheet information for the significant assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs, which are included in our balance sheets (in millions):

1 DGD produces synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK), a renewable blending component, using the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process. SPK is also commonly referred to as “neat SAF.” Current aviation regulations allow SPK to be blended up to 50 percent with conventional jet fuel for use in an aircraft. This blend is commonly referred to as “blended SAF” or “SAF.”

Nonconsolidated VIEs

We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. These nonconsolidated VIEs are not material to our financial position or results of operations and are accounted for as equity investments.

9\. REVENUES AND SEGMENT INFORMATION

  

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Disaggregation of Revenue

Revenue is presented in the table below under “Segment Information” disaggregated by product because this is the level of disaggregation that management has determined to be beneficial to users of our financial statements.

  

Contract Balances

Contract balances were as follows (in millions):

                                                                                                                                            
                                                                        March 31,2025         December 31,2024         
Receivables from contracts with customers,included in receivables, net  $              6,090                        $  5,812        
Contract liabilities, included in accrued expenses                      57                                      82              

  

Remaining Performance Obligations

We have spot and term contracts with customers, the majority of which are spot contracts with no remaining performance obligations. We do not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts that have terms of one year or less. The transaction price for our remaining term contracts includes a fixed component and variable consideration (i.e., a commodity price), both of which are allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good that forms part of a single performance obligation. The fixed component is not material and the variable consideration is highly uncertain. Therefore, as of March 31, 2025, we have not disclosed the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations.

  

Segment Information

We have three reportable segments—Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol. Each segment is a strategic business unit that offers different products and services by employing unique technologies and marketing strategies and whose operations and operating performance are managed and evaluated separately. Operating performance is measured based on the operating income generated by the segment, which includes revenues and expenses that are directly attributable to the management of the respective segment. Intersegment sales are generally derived from transactions made at prevailing market rates. The following is a description of each segment’s business operations.

  

•The Refining segment includes the operations of our petroleum refineries, the associated activities to market our refined petroleum products, and the logistics assets that support our refining operations. The principal products manufactured by our refineries and sold by this segment include gasolines and blendstocks, distillates, and other products.

  

•The Renewable Diesel segment represents the operations of DGD, a consolidated joint venture as discussed in Note 6, and the associated activities to market renewable diesel, renewable naphtha, and neat SAF. The principal products manufactured by DGD and sold by this segment are renewable diesel, renewable naphtha, and neat SAF. This segment sells some renewable diesel

and neat SAF to the Refining segment for blending into petroleum-based diesel and conventional jet fuel, respectively, which is then sold to that segment’s customers as finished product.

•The Ethanol segment includes the operations of our ethanol plants and the associated activities to market our ethanol and co-products. The principal products manufactured by our ethanol plants are ethanol and distillers grains. This segment sells some ethanol to the Refining segment for blending into gasoline, which is sold to that segment’s customers as a finished gasoline product.

  

Operations that are not included in any of the reportable segments are included in the corporate category.

  

Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. Our CODM uses operating income by segment to allocate resources (including employees, property, and financial or capital resources) for each segment primarily during the annual budget process. On a monthly basis, our CODM considers budget-to-actual variances for operating income by segment when evaluating the operating performance of each segment.

Changes in current assets and current liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were primarily due to the following:

  

•The increase in receivables was primarily due to an increase in refined petroleum product sales volumes combined with an increase in related prices in March 2025 compared to December 2024, partially offset by the collection of $246 million for a blender’s tax credit receivable; and

  

•The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower inventory levels in March 2025 compared to December 2024.

  

Changes in current assets and current liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were primarily due to the following:

  

•The decrease in receivables was primarily due to a decrease in refined petroleum product sales volumes in March 2024 compared to December 2023, partially offset by an increase in related prices; and

•The increase in inventories was due to an increase in inventory volumes valued at higher unit prices in March 2024 compared to December 2023.

11\. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

  

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The following tables present information (in millions) about our assets and liabilities recognized at their fair values in our balance sheets categorized according to the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

  

We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral assets or obligations as shown below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented in the following tables on a gross basis. We have no derivative contracts that are subject to master netting arrangements that are reflected gross in our balance sheets.

A description of our assets and liabilities recognized at fair value along with the valuation methods and inputs we used to develop their fair value measurements are as follows:

  

•Commodity derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures, which are used to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows as discussed in Note 12. These contracts are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

  

•Physical purchase contracts represent the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts. The fair values of these purchase contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange or an independent pricing service and are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

  

•Blending program obligations represent our liability for the purchase of compliance credits needed to satisfy our blending obligations under various government and regulatory blending programs, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations, U.K. Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, and similar programs in other jurisdictions in which we operate (collectively, the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs). The blending program

obligations are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from an independent pricing service.

•Investments of certain benefit plans consist of investment securities held by trusts for the purpose of satisfying a portion of our obligations under certain U.S. nonqualified benefit plans. The plan assets categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from national securities exchanges. The plan assets categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy represent insurance contracts, the fair value of which is provided by the insurer.

  

•Investments in AFS debt securities consist primarily of commercial paper and U.S. government treasury bills and have maturities within one year. The securities categorized in Level 1 are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from national securities exchanges and the securities categorized in Level 2 are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from independent pricing services. The amortized cost basis of the securities approximates fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses were de minimis for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

  

•Foreign currency contracts consist of foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts related to our foreign operations to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of our operations. These contracts are valued based on quoted foreign currency exchange rates and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

  

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

The following table presents information (in millions) about our nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and categorized according to the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of March 31, 2025.

As discussed in Note 2, we concluded that the carrying values of the Benicia and Wilmington refineries were impaired as of March 31, 2025. The fair values of the refineries were determined using a market approach based on a comparison of recent property sales and other relevant real estate and market data,

12\. PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

  

General

We are exposed to market risks primarily related to the volatility in the price of commodities, foreign currency exchange rates, and the price of credits needed to comply with the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs. We enter into derivative instruments to manage some of these risks, including derivative instruments related to the various commodities we purchase or produce, and foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below under “Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk.” These derivative instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values (see Note 11), as summarized below under “Fair Values of Derivative Instruments.” The effect of these derivative instruments on our income and other comprehensive income (loss) is summarized below under “Effect of Derivative Instruments on Income and Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).”

  

Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of feedstocks (primarily crude oil, waste and renewable feedstocks, and corn); the products we produce; and natural gas and electricity used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, such as futures and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that is periodically reviewed with our Board and/or relevant Board committee.

We primarily use commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges and economic hedges. Our objectives for entering into each type of hedge is described below.

  

•Cash flow hedges – The objective of our cash flow hedges is to lock in the price of forecasted purchases and/or product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable.

•Economic hedges – Our objectives for holding economic hedges are to (i) manage price volatility in certain feedstock and product inventories and (ii) lock in the price of forecasted purchases and/or product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable.

  

As of March 31, 2025, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were used as cash flow hedges and economic hedges, as well as commodity derivative instruments related to the physical purchase of corn at a fixed price. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels, except corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels).

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our foreign operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of our operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we often use foreign currency contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and therefore are classified as economic hedges. As of March 31, 2025, we had foreign currency contracts to purchase $174 million of U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or before April 16, 2025.

  

Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs Price Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase

exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. The Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs require us to blend a certain volume of renewable and low-carbon fuels into the petroleum-based transportation fuels we produce in, or import into, the respective jurisdiction to be consumed therein based on annual quotas. To the degree we are unable to blend at the required quotas, we must purchase compliance credits (primarily Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs)). The cost of meeting our credit obligations under the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs was $332 million and $204 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts are reflected in cost of materials and other.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The following table provides information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 (in millions) and the line items in our balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. See Note 11 for additional information related to the fair values of our derivative instruments.

  

As indicated in Note 11, we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements, including cash collateral assets and obligations. The following table, however, is presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis, which results in the reflection of certain assets in liability accounts and certain liabilities in asset accounts:

Market Risk

Our price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, which is the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies that are periodically reviewed with our Board and/or relevant Board committee. Market risks are monitored by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy. We do not require any collateral or other security to support derivative instruments into which we enter. We also do not have any derivative instruments that require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit rating.

For cash flow hedges, no component of any derivative instrument’s gain or loss was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, cash flow hedges primarily related to forecasted sales of renewable diesel. As of March 31, 2025, the estimated deferred after-tax loss that is expected to be reclassified into revenues within the next 12 months was not material. The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 are described in Note 5.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

  

The following discussions in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK,” “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” and “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” include references to financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable); Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin; and capital investments attributable to Valero. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods, to help assess our cash flows, and because we believe they provide useful information as discussed further below. See the tables in note (b) beginning on page 43 for reconciliations of adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable) and Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also in note (b), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of such non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. See the table on page 48 for a reconciliation of capital investments attributable to Valero to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Beginning on page 47, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information.

  

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

  

Overview

Business Operations Update

Our results for the first quarter of 2025 were supported by stable worldwide demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels. However, our results were also impacted by heavy maintenance activities and a challenging margin environment. In addition, we recognized an asset impairment loss of $1.1 billion ($877 million after taxes) associated with our operations in California, as described in Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

  

We reported a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $595 million for the first quarter of 2025. Our operating results, including operating results by segment, are described in the following summary under “First Quarter Results,” and detailed descriptions can be found under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” beginning on page 36.

  

Our operations generated $952 million of cash during the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we issued $650 million of 5.150 percent Senior Notes due February 15, 2030 during the first quarter of 2025, as described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The cash generated by our operations, along with the net proceeds from our debt issuance and cash on hand, was used to make $660 million of capital investments in our business, return $630 million to our stockholders through purchases of common stock for treasury and dividend payments, and repay the $189 million outstanding principal balance of our 3.65 percent Senior Notes that matured in March 2025. As a result of this and other activity, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased by $22 million during the first quarter of 2025 to $4.8 billion as of March 31, 2025. We had $9.7 billion in liquidity as of March 31, 2025. The components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows, capital investments, and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources can be found under “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” beginning on page 45.

First Quarter Results

For the first quarter of 2025, we reported a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $595 million compared to net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $1.2 billion for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease of $1.8 billion was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of $2.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $618 million. The details of our operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income, where applicable, by segment and in total are reflected below (in millions). Adjusted operating income excludes the adjustments reflected in the tables in note (b) beginning on page 43.

While our operating income decreased by $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024, adjusted operating income decreased by $1.5 billion primarily due to the following:

  

•Refining segment. Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to lower gasoline and distillate (primarily diesel) margins, a decline in crude oil differentials, and higher operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), partially offset by higher margins on other products.

  

•Renewable Diesel segment. Renewable Diesel segment operating income decreased by $331 million primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes and higher feedstock costs.

  

•Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by $19 million primarily due to higher corn prices, lower corn related co-product prices, and higher operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), partially offset by higher ethanol prices.

Outlook

Many uncertainties remain with respect to the supply and demand balances in petroleum-based product markets worldwide. While it is difficult to predict future worldwide economic activity and its resulting impact on product supply and demand, including the effects of tariffs thereon, we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the second quarter of 2025.

  

•Gasoline and diesel demand have exceeded pre-pandemic levels and are expected to follow typical seasonal patterns. Jet fuel demand continues to improve, outpacing gasoline and diesel demand growth, and is approaching pre-pandemic levels in the U.S.

  

•Combined light product (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) inventories across the U.S. and Europe remain comparable to recent historical levels. Expected reductions in refining capacity in 2025 should support utilization of refining capacity.

  

•Crude oil differentials are expected to remain relatively stable. However, potential sanction adjustments related to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and an expected increase in sour crude production from OPEC+ suppliers could result in increased volatility in the crude oil market and potentially impact crude oil differentials.

  

•Renewable diesel demand is expected to remain consistent with current levels.

  

•Ethanol demand is expected to follow typical seasonal patterns.

Revenues decreased by $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to decreases in product prices for the petroleum-based transportation fuels associated with sales made by our Refining segment. This decrease in revenues, along with the effect of an asset impairment loss of $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025 (see note (a)), resulted in a $2.6 billion decrease in operating income, from operating income of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to an operating loss of $900 million in the first quarter of 2025.

  

Adjusted operating income decreased by $1.5 billion, from $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to $235 million in the first quarter of 2025. The components of this $1.5 billion decrease in adjusted operating income are discussed by segment in the segment analyses that follow.

  

Income tax expense decreased by $618 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate was 29 percent in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 21 percent in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in U.S. income before income tax expense resulting

Refining segment operating income decreased by $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025; however, Refining segment adjusted operating income, which excludes the adjustments in the table in note (b), decreased by $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024. The components of this decrease in the adjusted results, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are outlined below.

  

•Refining segment margin decreased by $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

  

Refining segment margin is primarily affected by the prices for the petroleum-based transportation fuels that we sell and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we process. The table on page 38 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe impacted our Refining segment margin in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

  

The decrease in Refining segment margin was primarily due to the following:

  

◦A decrease in distillate (primarily diesel) margins had an unfavorable impact of approximately $680 million.

  

◦A decrease in gasoline margins had an unfavorable impact of approximately $300 million.

Renewable Diesel segment operating income decreased by $331 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to a decrease in Renewable Diesel segment margin of $340 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

  

Renewable Diesel segment margin is primarily affected by the prices for the renewable fuels that we sell and the cost of the feedstocks that we process. The table on page 39 reflects market reference prices that we believe impacted our Renewable Diesel segment margin in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

The decrease in Renewable Diesel segment margin was primarily due to the following:

  

•A decrease in sales volumes of 1.3 million gallons per day had an unfavorable impact of approximately $170 million. The decrease in sales volumes was primarily due to reduced production resulting from planned maintenance activities at the DGD St. Charles Plant in the first quarter of 2025.

  

•An increase in the cost of the feedstocks that we process had an unfavorable impact of approximately $90 million.

Ethanol segment operating income increased by $10 million in the first quarter of 2025; however, Ethanol segment adjusted operating income, which excludes the adjustment in the table in note (b), decreased by $19 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024. The components of this decrease in the adjusted results, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are outlined below. 

  

•Ethanol segment margin decreased by $2 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

  

Ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by prices for the ethanol and corn related co-products that we sell and the cost of corn that we process. The table on page 39 reflects market reference prices that we believe impacted our Ethanol segment margin in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

  

The decrease in Ethanol segment margin was primarily due to the following:

  

◦An increase in corn prices had an unfavorable impact of approximately $45 million.

◦A decrease in prices for the co-products that we produce, primarily dry distillers grains, had an unfavorable impact of approximately $30 million.

◦An increase in ethanol prices had a favorable impact of approximately $70 million.

•Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $17 million primarily due to an increase in energy costs.

(a)In late March 2025, we approved a plan with respect to the operations at our Benicia Refinery and currently intend to cease refining operations by the end of April 2026. In addition, we considered strategic alternatives for our remaining operations in California. As a result, we evaluated the assets of the Benicia and Wilmington refineries for impairment as of March 31, 2025 and concluded that the carrying values of these assets were not

recoverable. Therefore, we reduced the carrying values of the Benicia and Wilmington refineries to their estimated fair values and recognized a combined asset impairment loss of $1.1 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2025.

  

(b)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.

  

We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.

  

Non-GAAP measures are as follows (in millions):

(c)The RVO cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the RFS program. The RVO cost is calculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class of renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the quotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels consumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding together the results of each calculation.

  

(d)We use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the Refining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who operate facilities similar to those included in our segments.

On February 7, 2025, we issued $650 million of 5.150 percent Senior Notes due February 15, 2030. Proceeds from this debt issuance totaled $649 million before deducting the underwriting discount and other debt issuance costs. A portion of the net proceeds from this debt issuance was used for the repayment of our outstanding 3.65 percent Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 and 2.850 percent Senior Notes due April 15, 2025. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

We believe we have sufficient funds from operations and from available capacity under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments over the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional cash through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.

Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2025

In the first quarter of 2025, we used the $952 million of cash generated by our operations, $2.5 billion from our debt issuance and borrowings, and $22 million of cash on hand to make $635 million of investments in our business, repay $2.1 billion of debt and finance lease obligations, and return $630 million to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments. The debt issuance, borrowings, and repayments are described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

  

As previously noted, our operations generated $952 million of cash in the first quarter of 2025, driven primarily by noncash charges to income of $1.4 billion and a positive change in working capital of $157 million. Noncash charges primarily included a $1.1 billion asset impairment loss associated with our operations in California, as described in Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and $691 million of depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $324 million deferred income tax benefit. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 10 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of the significant components of our net loss.

Our investing activities of $635 million primarily consisted of $660 million in capital investments, as defined below under “Capital Investments,” of which $95 million related to capital investments made by DGD.

  

Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024

In the first quarter of 2024, we used the $1.8 billion of cash generated by our operations, $1.4 billion in debt borrowings, and $507 million of cash on hand to make $637 million of investments in our business, repay $1.7 billion of debt and finance lease obligations, and return $1.4 billion to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments. The debt borrowings and repayments are described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As previously noted, our operations generated $1.8 billion of cash in the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by net income of $1.3 billion and noncash charges to income of $676 million, partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $160 million. Noncash charges primarily included $695 million of depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $69 million deferred income tax benefit. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 10 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.

  

Our investing activities of $637 million primarily consisted of $661 million in capital investments, of which $78 million related to capital investments made by DGD.

  

Our Capital Resources

Our material cash requirements as of March 31, 2025 primarily consisted of working capital requirements, capital investments, contractual obligations, and other matters, as described below. Our operations have historically generated positive cash flows to fulfill our working capital requirements and other uses of cash as discussed below.

  

Capital Investments

Capital investments are composed of our capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, as reflected in our statements of cash flows as shown on page 5. Capital investments exclude acquisitions, if any.

We have publicly announced GHG emissions reduction/displacement targets and a long-term ambition. We believe that our allocation of growth capital into low-carbon projects to date has been consistent with such targets and ambition. Certain low-carbon projects have been completed or are already in execution and the associated capital investments are included in our expected capital investments for 2025. Our capital investments in future years to achieve these targets and ambition are expected to include investments associated with certain low-carbon projects currently at various stages of progress, evaluation, or approval. For additional information, see the “RISK FACTORS” section included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

  

Capital Investments Attributable to Valero

Capital investments attributable to Valero is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, excluding the portion of DGD’s capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of other consolidated VIEs.

Table of Contents

We are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and consolidate its financial statements, and DGD’s operations compose our Renewable Diesel segment. As a result, all of DGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities. In general, DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments. We also exclude all of the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we consolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. See Note 6 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the VIEs that we consolidate. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.

  

Capital investments attributable to Valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments, which is the most comparable GAAP measure, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently, which may diminish its utility.

  

The following table (in millions) reconciles our capital investments to capital investments attributable to Valero for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

We have developed an extensive multi-year capital investment program, which we update and revise based on changing internal and external factors. As previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, we expect to incur approximately $2.0 billion for capital investments attributable to Valero during 2025.

Contractual Obligations

As of March 31, 2025, our contractual obligations included debt obligations, interest payments related to debt obligations, operating lease liabilities, finance lease obligations, other long-term liabilities, and purchase obligations. In the ordinary course of business, we had debt-related activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, as described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to our contractual obligations during the three months ended March 31, 2025.

  

Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources

Stock Purchase Programs

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we purchased for treasury 2,074,605 of our shares for a total cost of $272 million. See Note 5 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our stock purchase programs. As of March 31, 2025, we had $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion remaining available for purchase under the February 2024 and September 2024 Programs, respectively. We will continue to evaluate the timing of purchases when appropriate. We have no obligation to make purchases under these programs.

  

Pension Plan Funding

As disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, we plan to contribute approximately $130 million to our pension plans and $20 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2025. No significant contributions were made to these plans during the three months ended March 31, 2025.

  

Cash Held by Our Foreign Subsidiaries

As of March 31, 2025, $3.8 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated to us through dividends without any U.S. federal income tax consequences, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions, U.S. state income taxes, and U.S. federal income tax on foreign exchange gains. Therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries to us.

  

Asset Retirement Obligations

See Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our asset retirement obligations.

  

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by government authorities relating to, among other matters, the release or discharge of materials into the environment, climate, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG and other emissions, our facilities and operations, and characteristics and composition of many of our products. Because environmental laws and regulations have become more complex and stringent and new or revised environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future costs and expenditures required for environmental matters could increase.

  

Concentration of Customers

Our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, including the uncertainties concerning worldwide events

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

  

INTEREST RATE RISK

  

The following tables provide information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A 10 percent increase or decrease in our floating interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. See Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt.

OTHER MARKET RISKS

  

We are exposed to market risks primarily related to the volatility in the price of commodities, the price of credits needed to comply with the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs, and foreign currency exchange rates. There have been no material changes to these market risks disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 12 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these market risks as of March 31, 2025.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

  

(a)Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025.

  

(b)Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION

  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

  

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, there were no new proceedings required to be disclosed in this item under SEC regulations and no material developments in proceedings that we previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Pursuant to SEC regulations, we use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of certain environmental proceedings is required in this item. We believe any such proceedings less than this threshold are not material to our business and financial condition.
