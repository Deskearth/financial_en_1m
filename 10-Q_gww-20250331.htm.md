NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

W.W. Grainger, Inc. is a broad line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America (N.A.), Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.

  

Basis of Presentation

The Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and therefore do not include all information and disclosures normally included in the annual Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from these estimated amounts. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation.

  

The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024, has been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.

  

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2024 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2025 (2024 Form 10-K).

  

There were no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies from those disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company's 2024 Form 10-K.

NOTE 2 - REVENUE

Grainger serves a large number of customers in diverse industries, which are subject to different economic and market-specific factors. The Company's revenue is primarily comprised of MRO product sales and related activities. 

  

The Company's presentation of revenue by reportable segment and customer industry most reasonably depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company's revenue and cash flows are affected by economic and market-specific factors. The majority of Company revenue originates from contracts with a single performance obligation to deliver products, whereby performance obligations are satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer per the arranged shipping terms. 

  

The following table presents the Company's percentage of revenue by reportable segment and customer industry:

(1) Customer industry results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 primarily use the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). As customers' businesses evolve, industry classifications may change. When these changes occur, Grainger does not recast the customer classification for prior periods as the industry used in the prior period was appropriate at the point-in-time. As a result, year-over-year changes may be impacted.  
(2) Total Company includes other businesses, which includes the Cromwell business. Other businesses account for approximately 2% of total Company revenue for both the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

(1) On February 18, 2025, Grainger repaid in full the principal amount of $500 million for the 1.85% Senior Notes that matured in February 2025. The related interest rate swaps with a notional value of $450 million that hedged a portion of the interest rate risk related to this debt expired on February 15, 2025.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

  

Senior Notes

Between 2015 and 2024, Grainger issued $2.8 billion in unsecured debt (Senior Notes) primarily to provide flexibility in funding general working capital needs, share repurchases and long-term cash requirements. The Senior Notes require no principal payments until maturity and interest is paid semi-annually. 

  

The Company incurred debt issuance costs related to its Senior Notes, representing underwriting fees and other expenses. These costs were recorded as a contra-liability in Long-term debt and are being amortized over the term of the Senior Notes using the straight-line method to Interest expense – net. The cumulative unamortized costs were $22 million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

  

Fair Value

The estimated fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes was based on available external pricing data and current market rates for similar debt instruments, among other factors, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.

  

NOTE 6 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

Grainger's two reportable segments are High-Touch Solutions N.A. (HTSNA) and Endless Assortment (EA). These reportable segments align with Grainger's go-to-market strategies and bifurcated business models of high-touch solutions and endless assortment that generate sales primarily through the distribution of MRO products. The remaining businesses are classified as Other to reconcile to consolidated results. These businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment.

  

The operating and reportable segments reflect the way the chief operating decision maker (CODM) evaluates the business. All expenses directly attributable to each reportable segment are included in the operating results for each segment. The CODM is not regularly provided and does not evaluate the segments using total asset or capital expenditure information and it is therefore not disclosed. For further discussion on the CODM, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company’s 2024 Form 10-K.

(1) Intersegment sales are recorded at values based on market prices, which creates intercompany profit sales that are eliminated within each segment to present only the impact of net sales to external customers.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger or Company) as it is viewed by management of the Company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2024 included in the Company's 2024 Form 10-K and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q.

  

Percentage figures included in this section have not been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or in the associated text.

  

Overview

Grainger is a broad line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the U.K. Grainger uses a combination of its high-touch solutions and endless assortment businesses to serve its customers worldwide, which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations.

  

Strategic Priorities

For a discussion of the Company’s strategic priorities for 2025, see Part 1, Item 1: Business and Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s 2024 Form 10-K.

  

Recent Events

Macroeconomic Conditions

The global economy continues to experience elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty, including within the commodity, labor, and transportation markets, driven by a combination of geopolitical developments and macroeconomic factors. Recent imposition of new and expanded tariffs have further contributed to disruptions in global capital markets and global supply chains. These developments may impact the Company’s operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

  

The Company is actively monitoring economic conditions in the U.S. and internationally, including the potential ramifications of evolving trade policies, changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, inflationary pressures, and the risk of a global or regional economic recession. In response to these factors, the Company has implemented various strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects of changing inflationary conditions and supply chain challenges, while continuing to maintain market price competitiveness.

  

Historically, the Company's broad and diverse customer base and the generally nondiscretionary nature of its products have provided a degree of resilience during periods of economic contraction in the industrial MRO market. However, the ultimate impact of ongoing macroeconomic conditions, including recent tariff-related developments, remains uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.

  

For further discussion of the Company's risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in the Company’s 2024 Form 10-K.

Non-GAAP Measures

Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. 

  

The Company adjusts its reported net sales to daily, constant currency net sales when there are differences in the number of U.S. selling days relative to the prior year period and also excludes the impact due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

  

The Company believes its non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Grainger’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, its most directly comparable GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

  

The following tables provide reconciliations of reported net sales growth from the prior year period in accordance with GAAP to the Company's non-GAAP measures daily net sales and daily, constant currency net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 (in millions of dollars):

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Grainger believes its current balances of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through cash flows generated from operations. Grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.

  

Cash and Cash Equivalents

As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $666 million and $1,036 million, respectively. The Company had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity as of March 31, 2025.

  

Cash Flows

The following table shows the Company's cash flow activity for the periods presented (in millions of dollars):

  

                                                                                                                              
                                                              Three Months Ended March 31,  
                                                              2025                                 2024   
Total cash provided by (used in):                                                                         
Operating activities                                          $                             646             $  661    
Investing activities                                          (125)                                (118)  
Financing activities                                          (898)                                (391)  
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  7                                    (8)    
Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents              $                             (370)           $  144    

  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $646 million and $661 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease was driven by unfavorable changes in working capital primarily due to inventory management and timing of cash payments compared to the prior year period.

  

Net cash used in investing activities was $125 million and $118 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase was due to capital expenditures driven by continued U.S. supply chain investments in the first quarter of 2025. 

  

Net cash used in financing activities was $898 million and $391 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of the 1.85% Senior Notes in the amount of $500 million.

  

Working Capital

Working capital as of March 31, 2025 was $3,198 million, a decrease of $84 million compared to $3,282 million as of December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.7 and 2.9, respectively.

  

Debt

Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. Grainger has various sources of financing available. 

  

Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 37.2% and 42.9% as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.

  

Grainger receives ratings from two independent credit rating agencies: Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). Both credit rating agencies currently rate the Company's corporate credit at investment grade.

There were no material changes to the Company’s commitments and other contractual obligations from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s 2024 Form 10-K.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Grainger’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. The Company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on Grainger’s consolidated financial position and results. While the Company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the Company’s management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

  

Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements of the Company's 2024 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as in other written reports, communications and verbal statements, Grainger makes forward-looking statements that are not historical in nature but concern forecasts of future results, business plans, analyses, prospects, strategies, objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” under the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “expect,” “could,” “forecast,” “may,” “intend,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will,” or “would,” and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.

  

Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized and achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Grainger's control, which could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those that are presented. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: inflation, higher product costs or other expenses, including operational and administrative expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of sources of supply; changes in customer or product mix; increased competitive pricing pressures; changes in third-party practices regarding digital advertising; failure to enter into or sustain contractual arrangements on a satisfactory basis with group purchasing organizations; failure to develop, manage or implement new technology initiatives or business strategies, including with respect to Grainger's eCommerce platforms and artificial intelligence; failure to adequately protect intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims; fluctuations or declines in Grainger's gross profit margin; Grainger's responses to market pressures; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings, including with respect to wage and hour, anti-bribery and corruption, environmental, regulations related to advertising, marketing and the internet, consumer protection, pricing (including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes), product liability, compliance or safety, trade and export compliance, general commercial disputes, or privacy and cybersecurity matters; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards, including new or stricter environmental laws or regulations; government contract matters; the impact of any government shutdown; disruption or breaches of information technology or data security systems involving Grainger or third parties on which Grainger depends; general industry, economic, market or political conditions; general global economic conditions including existing, new, or increased tariffs, trade issues and changes in trade policies, inflation, and interest rates; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility, including price and trading volume volatility or price declines of Grainger's common stock; commodity price volatility; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; effects of outbreaks of pandemic disease or viral contagions, global conflicts, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, and other catastrophes or conditions; effects of climate change; failure to execute on our efforts and programs related to environmental, social and governance matters; competition for, or failure to attract, retain, train, motivate and develop executives and key team members; loss of key members of management or key team members; loss of operational flexibility and potential for work stoppages or slowdowns if team members unionize or join a collective bargaining arrangement; changes in effective tax rates; changes in credit ratings or outlook; Grainger's incurrence of indebtedness or failure to comply with restrictions and obligations under its debt agreements and instruments and other factors identified under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in Grainger's latest Form 10-K, as updated from time to time in Grainger's Quarterly Form 10-Q.

  

The preceding list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of the factors that could impact Grainger's forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward looking-statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
