CASELLA WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1\. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Casella Waste Systems, Inc. (“Parent”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we”, “us” or “our”), is a regional, vertically integrated solid waste services company. We provide resource management expertise and services to residential, commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of solid waste collection and disposal, transfer, recycling and organics services.

We provide integrated solid waste services in ten states: Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, with our headquarters located in Rutland, Vermont. We manage our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through three regional operating segments, the Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions, each of which provides a comprehensive range of non-hazardous solid waste services. We manage our resource renewal operations through the Resource Solutions operating segment, which leverages our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers that have more diverse waste and recycling needs. Legal, tax, information technology, human resources, certain finance and accounting and other administrative functions are included in our Corporate Entities segment.

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Parent and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under either the equity method or the cost method of accounting, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (“fiscal year 2024”), which was filed with the SEC on February 18, 2025 (“2024 Form 10-K”).

Preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision given the available data, or simply cannot be readily calculated. In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, including normal recurring and nonrecurring adjustments, as applicable, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 may not be indicative of the results for any other interim period or the entire fiscal year. The consolidated financial statements presented herein should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Subsequent Events

We have evaluated subsequent events or transactions that have occurred after the consolidated balance sheet date of March 31, 2025 through the date of filing of the consolidated financial statements with the SEC on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as disclosed, no material subsequent events have occurred since March 31, 2025 through the date of this filing that would require recognition or adjustments to our disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.

ASU No. 2023-09: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740)                                         Requires entities to provide additional disclosure related to the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures, including additional disclosure around the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid.    We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, however, the adoption of this guidance will have an impact on income tax disclosures within the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
ASU No. 2024-03: Improvements to Income Statement - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)    Requires entities to provide additional disclosure related to more detailed information about specific types of expenses contained in commonly presented expense captions on the statements of operations.

(1)Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified between regional operating segments to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 13, Segment Reporting for further disclosure.

Payments to customers that are not in exchange for a distinct good or service are recorded as a reduction of revenues. Rebates to certain customers associated with payments for recycled or organic materials that are received and subsequently processed and sold to other third-parties amounted to $8,940 in the three months ended March 31, 2025 and $7,115 in the three months ended March 31, 2024. Rebates are generally recorded as a reduction of revenues upon the sale of such materials, or upon receipt of the recycled materials at our facilities. We did not record revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2025 or March 31, 2024 from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. 

Contract receivables, which are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets, are recorded when billed or when related revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against third-parties that will be settled in cash. Accounts receivable, net includes receivables from contracts of $170,907 and $162,916 as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Certain customers are billed in advance and, accordingly, recognition of the related revenues for which payment has been received is deferred as a contract liability until the services are provided and control transferred to the customer. We recognized contract liabilities of $49,724 and $50,690 as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Due to the short term nature of advanced billings, substantially all of the deferred revenue recognized as a contract liability as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, when the services were performed.

4\. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we acquired three businesses: two tuck-in collection operations in our Mid-Atlantic region, and a tuck-in collection operation and recycling business whose assets and liabilities are allocated between our Eastern region and Resource Solutions operating segments. We did not acquire any businesses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.

The operating results of the businesses acquired prior to March 31, 2025 have been included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations from each date of acquisition, and each purchase price has been allocated to the net assets acquired based on fair values at the date of each acquisition with the residual amounts recorded as goodwill. Purchase price allocations are based on information existing at the acquisition dates or upon closing the transactions. Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill that are subject to amortization may include customer relationships, trade names and covenants not-to-compete. Such assets are amortized over a two-year to ten-year period from the date of acquisition.

Goodwill acquired is primarily associated with the value of acquired businesses, based on current and anticipated operating performance, in excess of the specific values allocated to other assets, new growth opportunities arising from the acquisitions, and expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and implementing our operating strategies. Substantially all amounts recorded to goodwill associated with acquisitions completed in the three months ended March 31, 2025 are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

A summary of the purchase price and the purchase price allocation for acquisitions follows:

6\. ACCRUED FINAL CAPPING, CLOSURE AND POST-CLOSURE COSTS

Accrued final capping, closure and post-closure costs include the current and non-current portion of costs associated with obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure of our landfills. We estimate our future final capping, closure and post-closure costs in order to determine the final capping, closure and post-closure expense per ton of waste placed into each landfill. The anticipated time frame for paying these costs varies based on the remaining useful life of each landfill as well as the duration of the post-closure monitoring period.

A summary of the changes to accrued final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities follows:

Credit Facility

The second amended and restated credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) provides for a $800,000 aggregate principal amount Term Loan Facility and a $700,000 Revolving Credit Facility, with a $155,000 sublimit for letters of credit (collectively, the "Credit Facility"). 

We have the right to request, at our discretion, an increase in the amount of loans under the Credit Facility by an aggregate amount of $200,000, subject to further increase based on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility has a 5-year term that matures in September 2029. The Credit Facility shall bear interest, at our election, at Term SOFR or at a base rate, in each case plus or minus any sustainable rate adjustment of up to positive or negative 4.0 basis points per annum, plus an applicable interest rate margin based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio as follows:

                                                                             
                   Term SOFR Loans     Base Rate Loans   
Credit Facility    1.300% to 2.175%    0.300% to 1.175%  

A commitment fee will be charged on undrawn amounts of our Revolving Credit Facility based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio in the range of 0.20% to 0.40% per annum, plus a sustainability adjustment of up to positive or negative 1.0 basis point per annum. The Credit Agreement provides that Term SOFR is subject to a zero percent floor. We are also required to pay a fronting fee for each letter of credit of 0.25% per annum. Interest under the Credit Agreement is subject to increase by 2.00% per annum during the continuance of a payment default and may be subject to increase by 2.00% per annum during the continuance of any other event of default. The Credit Facility is guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets. As of March 31, 2025, further advances were available under the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $675,403. The available amount is net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling $24,597, and as of March 31, 2025 no amount had been drawn. 

The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, to be measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. In addition to these financial covenants, the Credit Agreement contains a number of important customary affirmative and negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, incur additional debt, create liens, make investments, and pay dividends. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. An event of default under any of our debt agreements could permit some of our lenders, including the lenders under the Credit Facility, to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, or, in the case of the Credit Facility, terminate the commitment to make further credit extensions thereunder, which could, in turn, trigger cross-defaults under other debt obligations. If we were unable to repay debt to our lenders or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and against the collateral securing that debt.

Tax-Exempt Financings

In fiscal year 2024, we completed the issuance of $45,000 aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2024, and $25,000 of the proceeds of such issuance was used for the repayment in full of FAME Bonds 2005R-3, which matured and were repaid in January 2025.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Current and non-current restricted cash is included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows is reconciled as follows:

Our restricted cash - non-current included on the consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash and assets as of March 31,2025 consisted of cash proceeds from the drawdown of the Vermont Bonds 2022A-2 and is restricted to finance or reimburse certain noncurrent asset costs associated with capital projects in the state of Vermont. Our restricted cash - current at December 31, 2024 consisted of cash proceeds from the issuance of the FAME Bonds 2024 restricted to be used for the repayment in full of FAME Bonds 2005R-3 on its stated maturity in January 2025.

Cash Flow Hedges

Our strategy to reduce exposure to interest rate risk involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates related to the variable rate portion of our long-term debt. We have designated these derivative instruments as highly effective cash flow hedges, and therefore the change in their fair value is recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax and included in interest expense at the same time as interest expense is affected by the hedged transactions. Differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt and included in cash flows from operating activities.

As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had $515,000 notional amount of active interest rate derivative agreements outstanding. These agreements mature between February 2026 and June 2028 and provide that we receive interest based on Term SOFR, restricted by a 0.0% floor, and pay interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 3.6%.

A summary of the effect of cash flow hedges related to derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets follows:

8\. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings 

In the ordinary course of our business and as the result of the extensive governmental regulation of the solid waste industry, we are subject to various judicial and administrative proceedings involving state and local agencies. In these proceedings, an agency may seek to impose fines or to revoke or deny renewal of an operating permit held by us. From time to time, we may also be subject to actions brought by special interest or other groups, adjacent landowners or residents in connection with the permitting and licensing of landfills and transfer stations, or allegations of environmental damage or violations of the permits and licenses pursuant to which we operate. In addition, we may be named defendants in various claims and suits pending for alleged damages to persons and property, alleged violations of certain laws and alleged liabilities arising out of matters occurring during the ordinary operation of a waste management business. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. These actions fall within various procedural stages at any point in time, and some are covered in part by insurance. 

In accordance with FASB ASC 450 - Contingencies, we accrue for legal proceedings, inclusive of legal costs, when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. We have recorded an aggregate accrual of $1,250 relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of March 31, 2025. It is reasonably possible that the estimated loss will change, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our legal proceedings to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible or remote that a liability has been incurred and, if it is at least reasonably possible, whether a range of loss can be reasonably estimated under the provisions of FASB ASC 450-20. In instances where we determine that a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate a range of loss we may incur with respect to such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate of the possible loss. If we are able to reasonably estimate a range, but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we record an accrual in the amount that is the low end of such range. When a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, we will not record an accrual, but we will disclose our estimate of the possible range of loss where such estimate can be made in accordance with FASB ASC 450-20. We disclose outstanding matters that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

North Country Environmental Services Letter of Deficiency

On June 14, 2024, our subsidiary, North Country Environmental Services, Inc. (“NCES”), received a Letter of Deficiency (the “Letter”) from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (“NHDES”) concerning alleged violations related to leachate management and leachate data and reporting. The Letter required certain actions to correct the deficiencies on a prescribed timeline, and NCES has met the deadlines for information submission. NCES has entered into preliminary discussions with the New Hampshire Department of Justice concerning an administrative order and associated penalties relative to the deficiencies. We believe that a liability related to this matter is probable and, accordingly, have recorded an accrual in excess of $1,000 of potential monetary penalties as of March 31, 2025.

Granite State Landfill Solid Waste Permit Denial

On April 3, 2025, NHDES denied the October 31, 2023 application of our subsidiary, Granite State Landfill, LLC (“GSL”) for the development of new landfill capacity in New Hampshire. On April 8, 2025, GSL petitioned the Merrimack Superior Court for a declaratory judgment that NHDES’s denial of GSL’s application was unlawful. As of March 31, 2025, we had $12,699 of capitalized project development costs related to the GSL landfill project included in other non-current assets.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to liability for environmental damage, including personal injury and property damage, that our solid waste, recycling and power generation facilities may cause to neighboring property owners, particularly as the result of the contamination of drinking water sources or soil, possibly including damage resulting from conditions that existed before we acquired the facilities. We may also be subject to liability for similar claims arising from off-site environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances if we or our predecessors arrange or arranged to transport, treat or dispose of those materials.

We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs become both probable and reasonably estimable. Determining the method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number of assumptions be made. There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with remediation of a site. In these cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. In the early stages of the remediation process, particular components of the overall liability may not be reasonably estimable; in this instance we use the components of the liability that can be reasonably estimated as a surrogate for the liability. It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities recorded for remediation to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We disclose outstanding environmental remediation matters that remain unsettled or are settled in the reporting period that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

We inflate the estimated costs in current dollars to the expected time of payment and discount the total cost to present value using a risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rates associated with our environmental remediation liabilities as of March 31, 2025 range between 1.5% and 7.1%. A summary of the changes to the aggregate environmental remediation liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 follows:

9\. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Stock Based Compensation

Shares Available For Issuance

In fiscal year 2024, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of our 2016 Incentive Plan (the “Amended 2016 Plan”). Under the Amended 2016 Plan, we may grant awards up to an aggregate amount of shares equal to the sum of: (A) 4,000 shares of Class A common stock (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits and other similar events) which is comprised of: (i) 1,750 shares of Class A common stock reserved for the issuance in connection with the Amended 2016 Plan, plus (ii) 2,250 shares of Class A common stock originally reserved for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan; plus (B) such additional number of shares of Class A common stock (up to approximately 2,723 shares) as is equal to the sum of the number of shares of Class A common stock that remained available for grant under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (“2006 Plan”) immediately prior to the expiration of the 2006 Plan and the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to awards granted under the 2006 Plan that expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered, canceled, forfeited or repurchased by us. As of March 31, 2025, there were 2,028 Class A common stock equivalents available for future grant under the Amended 2016 Plan.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at a price equal to the prevailing fair value of our Class A common stock at the date of grant. Generally, stock options granted have a term not to exceed ten years and vest over a one-year to five-year period from the date of grant.

The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses a risk-free interest rate, based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the period of the expected life of the stock option; and requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation, including estimates of: the expected term, calculated based on the weighted averaged historical life of vested stock options, giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns; and the expected volatility, calculated using the weekly historical volatility of our Class A common stock over the expected life of the stock option.

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $133 during the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to $151 during the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, we had $1,395 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding stock options to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised was zero dollars.

Other Stock Awards

Restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units, with the exception of market-based performance stock units, are granted at a price equal to the fair value of our Class A common stock at the date of grant. The fair value of each market-based performance stock unit is estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model, which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation, including the estimated share price appreciation plus, if applicable, the value of dividends of our Class A common stock as compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the requisite service period. 

Typically, restricted stock awards granted to non-employee directors vest incrementally over a three-year period beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock units granted to employees vest incrementally over an identified service period, typically three years, beginning on the grant date based on continued employment. Performance stock units granted to employees, including market-based performance stock units, vest at a future date following the grant date and are based on the attainment of performance targets and market achievements, as applicable.

A summary of restricted stock award, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit activity follows:

The weighted average fair value of market-based performance stock units granted during the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $118.64 per award, which was calculated using a Monte Carlo pricing model assuming a risk-free interest rate of 3.95% and an expected volatility of 25.1% assuming no expected dividend yield. Risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the expected service period of the award. Expected volatility is calculated using the daily volatility of our Class A common stock over the expected service period of the award.

The Monte Carlo pricing model requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.

We also recorded $169 of stock-based compensation expense related to the Second Amended and Restated 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to $109 during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

10\. LOSS PER SHARE

Basic loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is calculated based on the combined weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive shares, which include the assumed exercise of employee stock options, unvested restricted stock awards, unvested restricted stock units and unvested performance stock units, including market-based performance units based on the expected achievement of performance targets. In computing diluted earnings per share, we utilize the treasury stock method.

A summary of the numerator and denominators used in the computation of loss per share attributable to common stockholders follows:

11\. OTHER ITEMS AND CHARGES

Expense from Acquisition Activities 

In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, we recorded charges of $5,529 and $5,010, respectively, comprised primarily of legal, consulting, rebranding and other costs associated with the due diligence, acquisition and integration of acquired businesses.

12\. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We use a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of market prices and observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, we rely on market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.

Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value

Our financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, restricted investment securities held in trust on deposit with various banks as collateral for our obligations relative to our landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs, interest rate derivatives, trade payables and debt. The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable and trade payables approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of restricted investment securities held in trust, which are valued using quoted market prices, are included as restricted assets in the Level 1 tier below. The fair value of the interest rate derivatives included in the Level 2 tier below is calculated using discounted cash flow valuation methodologies based upon Term SOFR yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swaps. We recognize all derivatives accounted for on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.

Fair Value of Debt

As of March 31, 2025, the fair value of our fixed rate debt, including our FAME Bonds 2015R-1, FAME Bonds 2015R-2, FAME Bonds 2024, Vermont Bonds 2013, Vermont Bonds 2022A-1, Vermont Bonds 2022A-2, New York Bonds 2014R-1, New York Bonds 2014R-2, New York Bonds 2020, New York Bonds 2020R-2 and New Hampshire Bonds (collectively, the “Industrial Revenue Bonds”) was approximately $277,316 and the carrying value was $277,000. The fair value of the Industrial Revenue Bonds is considered to be Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined using market approach pricing provided by a third-party that utilizes pricing models and pricing systems, mathematical tools and judgment to determine the evaluated price for the security based on the market information of each of the bonds or securities with similar characteristics. 

As of March 31, 2025, the carrying value of our Term Loan Facility was $800,000 and the carrying value of our Revolving Credit Facility was zero dollars. Their fair values are based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements, or Level 2 inputs, and approximate their carrying values.

Although we have determined the estimated fair value amounts of the Industrial Revenue Bonds using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, a change in available market information, and/or the use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values. These amounts have not been revalued, and current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.

13\. SEGMENT REPORTING

We report selected information about our reportable operating segments in a manner consistent with that used for internal management reporting. We classify our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through three regional operating segments, our Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we moved certain operations between our regional operating segments to align geographically, including a landfill that we own from the Western region to the Mid-Atlantic region and a collection and transfer station operation from our Western region to our Eastern region. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified between regional operating segments to conform to the current period presentation.

Revenues associated with our solid waste operations are derived mainly from solid waste collection and disposal services, including landfill, transfer station and transportation services, landfill gas-to-energy services, and processing services in the eastern United States. Our Resource Solutions operating segment leverages our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers that have more diverse waste and recycling needs. Revenues associated with our Resource Solutions operations are comprised of processing services and our National Accounts business. Revenues from processing services are derived from customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees, commodity sales, and organic material sales. Revenues from our National Accounts business are derived from brokerage services and overall resource management services providing a wide range of environmental services and resource management solutions to large and complex organizations, as well as traditional collection, disposal and recycling services provided to large account multi-site customers. Legal, tax, information technology, human resources, certain finance and accounting and other administrative functions are included in our Corporate Entities segment, which is not a reportable operating segment. Operating income by segment reported in the three months ended March 31, 2024 has been updated to conform with the presentation for the three months ended March 31, 2025, which includes the movement of certain operations described above and does not have Corporate Entities costs allocated to our reportable operating segments. See Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for the breakout of goodwill by reportable operating segment.

The accounting policies of our reportable operating segments are the same as those described in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of our 2024 Form 10-K. Our President is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). Our CODM uses operating income in evaluating reportable operating segment performance in order to properly allocate resources and make key operating decisions. Intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the computation of consolidated gross revenues and operating income.

The CODM uses operating income for each reportable operating segment in the annual budget and forecasting process and considers budget-to-actual and forecast-to-actual variances on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each reportable operating segment.

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2025 follows:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item 1. “Financial Statements”. In addition, reference should be made to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (“fiscal year 2024”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 18, 2025 (“2024 Form 10-K”).

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in particular, this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, may contain or incorporate a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding:

•our ability to consummate business acquisitions or divestitures, integrate acquired businesses and operations and achieve the expected benefits, including the expected annualized revenues from such acquired businesses and operations;

•our ability to achieve the key strategies of our long-term strategic plan;

•the projected development of additional disposal capacity or expectations regarding permits for existing capacity;

•the outcome of any legal or regulatory matter;

•expected liquidity and financing plans;

•expected future revenues, operations, expenditures and cash needs;

•whether our pricing programs and operational initiatives will outpace higher operating and construction costs from inflation and regulatory changes;

•severe weather conditions, which could impair our financial results by causing increased costs, loss of revenue, reduced operational efficiency or disruptions to our operations;

•projected future obligations related to final capping, closure and post-closure costs of our existing landfills and any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future;

•our ability to use our net operating losses and tax positions;

•our ability to service our debt obligations;

In addition, any statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this report that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of the words “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “intends”, “estimates” and other similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, as well as management’s beliefs and assumptions, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. The occurrence of the events described and the achievement of the expected results depends on many events, some or all of which are not predictable or within our control. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

There are a number of important risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, those detailed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our 2024 Form 10-K.

There may be additional risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial, which could have an adverse impact on our business. We explicitly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.

Company Overview

Casella Waste Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “we”, “us” or “our”), is a regional, vertically integrated solid waste services company. We provide resource management expertise and services to residential, commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of solid waste collection and disposal, transfer, recycling and organics services. 

We provide integrated solid waste services in ten states: Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland, with our headquarters located in Rutland, Vermont. We manage our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through three regional operating segments, the Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions, each of which provides a comprehensive range of non-hazardous solid waste services. We manage our resource renewal operations through the Resource Solutions operating segment, which leverages our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers that have more diverse waste and recycling needs. Legal, tax, information technology, human resources, certain finance and accounting and other administrative functions are included in our Corporate Entities segment.

As of April 15, 2025, we owned and/or operated 76 solid waste collection operations, 70 transfer stations, 31 recycling facilities, eight Subtitle D landfills, three landfill gas-to-energy facilities and one landfill permitted to accept construction and demolition (“C&D”) materials. We also housed two landfill gas-to-energy facilities, which are owned and operated by third parties, at landfills we owned and/or operated.

Results of Operations

Revenues

We manage our solid waste operations, which include a full range of solid waste services, on a geographic basis through three regional operating segments, which we designate as the Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we moved certain operations between our regional operating segments, including a landfill that we own from the Western region to the Mid-Atlantic region and a collection and transfer station operation from our Western region to our Eastern region. Throughout this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” certain prior period amounts have been reclassified between regional operating segments to conform to the current period presentation. For additional information, see Note 13, Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements included under Part I. Item 1. “Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Revenues associated with our solid waste operations are derived mainly from fees charged to customers for solid waste collection and disposal services, including landfill, transfer station and transportation services, landfill gas-to-energy services, and processing services in the eastern United States. We derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial, industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities. The majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual property owners or occupants. Landfill and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations. We also generate and sell electricity at certain of our landfill facilities. We manage our resource renewal operations through the Resource Solutions operating segment, which includes processing services and services provided by our National Accounts business. Revenues from processing services are derived from customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees, commodity sales, primarily comprised of newspaper, corrugated containers, plastics, ferrous and aluminum, and organic materials such as our earthlife® soils products including fertilizers, composts and mulches. Revenues from our National Accounts business are derived from brokerage services and overall resource management services providing a wide range of environmental services and resource management solutions to large and complex organizations, as well as traditional collection, disposal and recycling services provided to large account multi-site customers.

The most significant items impacting the change in our solid waste revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the prior year period are summarized below:

•Price increased solid waste revenues, including $12.2 million, or 5.8% as a percentage of collection revenues, from higher collection pricing and $2.7 million, or 5.5% as a percentage of disposal revenues, from higher disposal pricing associated with our landfills and transfer stations.

•Volume decreased solid waste revenues, including $(3.6) million, or (1.7)% as a percentage of collection revenues, from lower collection volumes and $(1.1) million, or (2.2)% as a percentage of disposal revenues, from lower disposal volumes, with lower transfer station volumes partially offset by higher landfill volumes.

•Acquisitions increased solid waste revenues due to the partial year impact of our acquisition of three businesses in the three months ended March 31, 2025, as well as the rollover impact of eight acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2024.

These cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories presented by other companies. 

The most significant items impacting the changes in our cost of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the prior year period are summarized below:

•Direct costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to acquisitions and higher third-party disposal rates.

•Direct labor costs increased primarily due to acquisitions and higher wage and benefit rates.

•Direct operational costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to (i) acquisitions, (ii) higher accruals related to insurance claims and legal penalties associated with leachate management at a landfill we own in our Eastern region, (iii) higher accretion expense associated with changes in the timing and cost estimates of our capping, closure and post-closure obligations, and (iv) general cost inflation; partially offset by lower leachate disposal costs. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Item 1. “Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further disclosure regarding the legal penalties accrual.

•Fuel costs increased in aggregate dollars due to acquisitions, partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices. See Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our fuel costs. 

•Maintenance and repair costs increased due to acquisitions and higher personnel and parts costs. 

•Other operational costs increased in aggregate dollars due to (i) acquisitions, (ii) higher spending associated with supporting acquisition-related growth, and (iii) general cost inflation.

General and Administration

General and administration expense includes: (i) labor costs, which consist of salaries, wages, incentive compensation and related benefit costs such as health and welfare benefits and workers compensation costs related to management, clerical and administrative functions; (ii) professional service fees; (iii) provision for expected credit losses; and (iv) other overhead costs including those associated with marketing, sales and community relations efforts.

A summary of the major components of our general and administration expense is as follows (dollars in millions and as a percentage of total revenues):

These cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories presented by other companies.

General and administration expense increased in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to (i) acquisition activity, including increased labor costs, professional service fees and other costs to support our growth and acquisition strategy, (ii) escalation of salary, wage, and benefit costs, (iii) higher accruals related to incentive compensation, and (iv) higher costs associated with information technology.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense includes: (i) depreciation of property and equipment (including assets recorded for finance leases) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets; (ii) amortization of landfill costs (including those costs incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development and construction, along with asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure obligations) on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and unpermitted expansion capacity that meets certain criteria for amortization purposes, and amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iii) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, based on the economic benefit provided, or using the sum of years digits or straight-line methods over the definitive terms of the related agreements.

A summary of the components of depreciation and amortization expense (dollars in millions and as a percentage of total revenues) is as follows:

Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to (i) acquisitions, including the impact of accelerated amortization schedules of certain intangibles, (ii) investment in property and equipment in our existing operations, and (iii) higher landfill amortization expense related to higher landfill volumes in our Western region, and changes in cost and other assumptions.

Expense from Acquisition Activities 

In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, we recorded charges of $5.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, comprised primarily of legal, consulting, rebranding and other costs associated with the due diligence, acquisition and integration of acquired businesses.

Other Expenses

Interest Expense, net

Our interest expense, net decreased $(1.5) million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower average interest rates in the three months ended March 31, 2025.

Benefit for Income Taxes

Our benefit for income taxes increased $1.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, from the prior year period. The benefit of $(3.3) million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, included zero dollars of current income taxes and $3.3 million of deferred income tax benefit. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the benefit of $(1.8) million included $0.6 million of current income taxes and $(2.4) million of deferred income tax benefit. The 40.9% effective rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was computed based on the statutory rate of 21% adjusted primarily for state taxes, nondeductible officer compensation, and an increase in the effective state rate due to tax losses in certain states requiring a valuation allowance; partially offset by tax deductible equity compensation in excess of book expense. This effective rate exceeded the 30.0% effective rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in the effective state rate for tax losses in certain states requiring valuation losses. 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJ Act”) was enacted. The TCJ Act significantly changed U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, changing carryforward rules for net operating losses. Depending on bonus depreciation and other elections made on the 2024 tax return when filed, we project to carry no pre-2018 net operating losses into 2025. Federal net operating losses generated after 2017, totaling $83.2 million carried forward to 2025, will be carried forward indefinitely, but generally may only offset up to 80% of taxable income earned in a tax year. 

In addition, the TCJ Act added limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and potentially could limit the deductibility of some of our interest expense. Any interest expense limited may be carried forward indefinitely and utilized in later years subject to the interest limitation.

Segment Reporting

As noted above, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified between regional operating segments to conform to the current period presentation reflecting the movement of certain operations between our regional operating segments.

Solid waste revenues increased in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by (i) the contribution from acquisitions, (ii) higher collection pricing of $4.3 million, or 5.7% as a percentage of collection revenues, and (iii) higher disposal pricing of $0.8 million, or 3.6% as a percentage of disposal revenues; partially offset by (a) lower disposal volume of $(2.4) million, or (10.2)% as a percentage of disposal revenues, primarily from transfer stations, (b) lower surcharges and other fees primarily due to lower energy and environmental fee (“E&E Fee(s)”) revenues associated with our fuel cost recovery program related to lower diesel fuel prices, as well as (c) lower collection volume of $(0.4) million, or (0.6)% as a percentage of collection revenues.

See Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the energy component of our E&E Fees.

Operating income increased in the three months ended March 31, 2025 by $1.6 million, as compared to the prior year period. The period-over-period increase was driven by (i) revenue growth, described above, (ii) higher intercompany related operating income, (iii) lower direct costs associated with lower collection and disposal volumes, and (iv) lower leachate disposal costs; partially offset by (a) higher accretion and landfill amortization expense associated with changes in the timing and cost estimates of our closure, post-closure, and capping obligations, (b) higher accruals related to insurance claims and legal penalties associated with leachate management at a landfill we own, (c) higher expense from acquisition activities, (d) increased depreciation expense due to acquisitions and investment in property and equipment, and (e) general cost inflation, including for disposal, labor, and maintenance costs. 

See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Item 1. “Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further disclosure regarding the legal penalties accrual.

Resource Solutions revenues increased in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by (i) higher National Accounts business volumes related to new business growth of $3.4 million, or 7.4% as a percentage of National Accounts revenues, (ii) National Accounts business pricing growth of $1.9 million, or 4.1% as a percentage of National Accounts revenues, (iii) higher tipping fees primarily related to contract structures that help to offset recycled commodity price movements of $0.9 million, or 3.8% as a percentage of related revenues, (iv) the contribution from acquisitions, (v) higher recycling volumes of $0.4 million, or 1.6% as a percentage of related revenues, (vi) higher other processing volumes of $0.4 million, or 7.8% as a percentage of related revenues, and (vii) higher other processing price of $0.2 million, or 3.9% as a percentage of related revenues; partially offset by lower surcharges and other fees revenues in our National Accounts business due to lower E&E Fee revenues associated with our fuel cost recovery program related to lower diesel fuel prices and lower recycled commodity price of $(0.2) million, or (1.0)% as a percentage of related revenues.

See Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the energy component of our E&E Fees.

Operating income increased in the three months ended March 31, 2025 by $0.6 million as compared to the prior year period. The period-over-period increase was due to revenue growth, described above; partially offset by (i) higher costs associated with operating and supporting acquired businesses, including the impact of accelerated amortization schedules of certain intangibles, (ii) higher expense from acquisition activities, (iii) increased depreciation expense due to acquisitions and investment in property and equipment, (iv) general cost inflation, including for disposal, labor, and maintenance costs, and (v) lower intercompany related operating income.

See further discussion about the expense from acquisition activities above in “Operating Expenses”.

Corporate Entities 

Corporate Entities operating loss reflects costs, including legal, tax, information technology, human resources, certain finance and accounting and other administrative functions, depreciation and amortization expense and certain expense from acquisition activities, which are not allocated to our reportable operating segments. 

Operating loss increased $(10.2) million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the prior year period. The period-over-period increase was due to (i) higher costs associated with supporting acquired businesses, (ii) general cost inflation for salaries, wages, benefits, professional services and other overhead costs including those associated with information technology, marketing, sales and community relations efforts, (iii) higher accruals related to incentive compensation, and (iv) higher depreciation expense associated with back office financial system infrastructure; partially offset by lower expense from acquisition activities. 

See further discussion about the expense from acquisition activities above in “Operating Expenses”.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity, and our capital requirements in order to properly manage our liquidity needs as we move forward based on the capital intensive nature of our business and our growth acquisition strategy. As of March 31, 2025, we had $675.4 million of available and undrawn capacity under our $700.0 million revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and $267.7 million of cash and cash equivalents to help meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents combined with available cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Our known current and long-term uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (i) acquisitions, (ii) capital expenditures and leases, (iii) repayments to service debt and other long-term obligations, and (iv) payments for final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation liabilities. We have made in the past, and plan to make in the future, acquisitions to expand service areas, densify existing operations, and grow services for our customers. Future acquisitions may include larger acquisitions that may be inside or outside of our existing market, which could require additional financing either in the form of debt or equity.

A summary of the most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows follows:

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $42.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. This was the result of business growth, including from acquisition activity, and a decrease in the unfavorable cash flow impact associated with the changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures.

A summary of the most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows follows:

Acquisitions, net of cash acquired. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we acquired three businesses for total consideration of $(103.5) million, all of which was cash consideration, and made $(0.1) million in payments on businesses previously acquired, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 during which we paid $(0.3) million on businesses previously acquired.

Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $25.2 million higher in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to acquisition activity and investment in our fleet; partially offset by lower landfill development spend, including the development of rail side infrastructure at our Subtitle D landfill located in Mount Jewitt, Pennsylvania in the prior year period.

Debt activity. Net cash associated with debt activity increased $5.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to the issuance in March 2025 of Vermont Economic Development Authority Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2022A-2 (“Vermont Bonds 2022A-2”) due June 2052; partially offset by the repayment in full of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2005R-3, which matured and were repaid in January 2025.

Payment of debt issuance costs. We paid $0.7 million of debt issuance costs in the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily related to the issuance of Vermont Bonds 2022A-2.

Outstanding Long-Term Debt

Credit Facility

As of March 31, 2025, we are party to the second amended and rested credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $800.0 million aggregate principal amount term loan A facility and a $700.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, with a $155.0 million sublimit for letters of credit (“collectively, the “Credit Facility”). We have the right to request, at our discretion, an increase in the amount of loans under the Credit Facility by an aggregate amount of $200.0 million, subject to further increase based on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility has a 5-year term that matures in September 2029. The Credit Facility shall bear interest, at our election, at term secured overnight financing rate (“Term SOFR”) or at a base rate, in each case plus or minus any sustainable rate adjustment of up to positive or negative 4.0 basis points per annum, plus an applicable interest rate margin based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio as follows:

                                                                             
                   Term SOFR Loans     Base Rate Loans   
Credit Facility    1.300% to 2.175%    0.300% to 1.175%  

A commitment fee will be charged on undrawn amounts of our Revolving Credit Facility based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio in the range of 0.20% to 0.40% per annum, plus a sustainability adjustment of up to positive or negative 1.0 basis point per annum. The Credit Agreement provides that Term SOFR is subject to a zero percent floor. We are also required to pay a fronting fee for each letter of credit of 0.25% per annum. Interest under the Credit Agreement is subject to increase by 2.00% per annum during the continuance of a payment default and may be subject to increase by 2.00% per annum during the continuance of any other event of default. The Credit Facility is guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets. As of March 31, 2025, further advances were available under the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $675.4 million. The available amount is net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling $24.6 million, and as of March 31, 2025 no amount had been drawn. 

The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, to be measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement as follows (in millions):

(1)The maximum consolidated net leverage ratio is calculated as consolidated funded debt, net of up to $100.0 million of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents (calculated at $1,051.2 million as of March 31, 2025, or $1,151.2 million of consolidated funded debt less $100.0 million total of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents), divided by consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated EBITDA is based on operating results for the twelve months preceding the measurement date of March 31, 2025. Consolidated funded debt, net and consolidated EBITDA as defined by the Credit Agreement (“Consolidated EBITDA”) are non-GAAP financial measures that should not be considered an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Consolidated EBITDA is as follows (in millions):

(1)Adjustments as allowed by the Credit Agreement includes the estimated annual pro forma impact of acquisitions on consolidated EBITDA.

In addition to these financial covenants, the Credit Agreement also contains a number of important customary affirmative and negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, incur additional debt, create liens, make investments, and pay dividends. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. We do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs. 

An event of default under any of our debt agreements could permit some of our lenders, including the lenders under the Credit Facility, to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, or, in the case of the Credit Facility, terminate the commitment to make further credit extensions thereunder, which could, in turn, trigger cross-defaults under other debt obligations. If we were unable to repay debt to our lenders or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and against the collateral securing that debt.

Based on the seasonality of our business, operating results in the late fall, winter and early spring months are generally lower than the remainder of our fiscal year. Given the cash flow impact that this seasonality, the capital intensive nature of our business and the timing of debt payments has on our business, we typically incur higher debt borrowings in order to meet our liquidity needs during these times. Consequently, our availability and performance against our financial covenants may tighten during these times as well.

Tax-Exempt Financings and Other Debt

As of March 31, 2025, we had outstanding $277.0 million aggregate principal amount of tax exempt bonds; $72.7 million aggregate principal amount of finance leases; and $1.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes payable. 

See Note 7, Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Item 1. “Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further disclosure regarding debt.

Inflation

Inflationary increases in costs have materially affected, and may continue to materially affect, our operating margins and cash flows. However, we believe that our flexible pricing structures and cost recovery fees are allowing us to recover and will continue to allow us to recover certain inflationary costs from our customer base. Consistent with industry practice, most of our contracts and service agreements provide for a pass-through of certain costs to our customers, including increases in landfill tipping fees and in most cases fuel costs, intended to mitigate the impact of inflation on our operating results. We have also implemented a number of operating efficiency programs that seek to improve productivity and reduce our service costs, and our fuel cost recovery programs, primarily the energy component of our E&E Fee, which is designed to recover escalating fuel price fluctuations above a periodically reset floor. Despite these programs, competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.

See Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our fuel cost recovery programs. 

Regional Economic Conditions

Our business is primarily located in the eastern United States. Therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region, such as state and local regulations, labor availability and severe weather conditions. We are unable to forecast or determine the timing and/or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown or other factors affecting the region.

Seasonality and Severe Weather

Our revenues historically have been higher in the late spring, summer and early fall months. This seasonality reflects lower volumes of waste in the late fall, winter and early spring months because the volume of waste relating to C&D activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the northeastern United States.

Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather, which may increase with the physical impacts of climate change and could increase our operating costs associated with the collection and disposal of waste, delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), decrease the throughput and operating efficiency of our materials recycling facilities, or delay construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. Our operations can also be favorably affected by severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services provided.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our critical accounting estimates are more fully discussed in Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. 

New Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of the new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, Accounting Changes to our consolidated financial statements included under Part I. Item 1. “Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks, including changes in diesel fuel prices, interest rates and certain commodity prices. We have a variety of strategies to mitigate these market risks, including those discussed below.

38

* * *

  

  

Fuel Price Risk

The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond our control, including among others, geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regional production patterns. Fuel is needed to run our fleet of trucks, equipment and other aspects of our operations, and price escalations for fuel increase our operating expenses. We have fuel cost recovery programs, primarily the energy component of our energy and environmental fee (“E&E Fee(s)”), which is designed to offset some or all of the impact of diesel fuel price increases above a periodically reset floor and contemplates a minimum customer participation level to cover changes in our fuel costs. The energy component of the E&E Fee floats on a monthly basis based upon changes in a published diesel fuel price index and is tied to a price escalation index with a look-back provision, which results in a timing lag in our ability to match the changes in the fuel cost component of the fee to diesel fuel price fluctuations during periods of rapid price changes. In certain circumstances, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could materially affect our revenue and costs of operations. However, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs should not have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are susceptible to increases in fuel surcharges from our vendors.

Based on our consumption levels in the last twelve months ended March 31, 2025, combined with our expected fuel consumption related to recently closed acquisitions, and after considering physically settled fuel contracts, we believe a $0.40 cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our direct fuel costs by approximately $6.1 million per year. Offsetting these changes in direct fuel expense would be changes in the energy component of the E&E Fees charged to our customers. Based on participation rates as of March 31, 2025 and considering recently closed acquisitions, we believe a $0.40 cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change the energy component of the E&E Fee by approximately $5.5 million per year. In addition to direct fuel costs related to our consumption levels, we are also subject to fuel surcharge expense from third party transportation providers. Other operational costs and capital expenditures may also be impacted by fuel prices.

In the three months ended March 31, 2025, our fuel costs were $15.8 million, or 3.8% of revenue, as compared to $13.8 million, or 4.0% of revenue, in the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Commodity Price Risk

We market a variety of materials, including fibers such as old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint, plastics, glass, ferrous and aluminum metals. We may use a number of strategies to mitigate impacts from these recycled material commodity price fluctuations including: (1) charging collection customers a floating sustainability recycling adjustment fee to reduce recycling commodity risks; (2) providing in-bound material recovery facilities (“MRF”) customers with a revenue share or indexed materials purchases in higher commodity price markets, or charging these same customers a processing cost or tipping fee per ton in lower commodity price markets; (3) selling recycled commodities to out-bound MRF customers through floor price or fixed price agreements; or (4) entering into fixed price contracts or hedges that mitigate the variability in cash flows generated from the sales of recycled paper at floating prices. Although we have introduced these risk mitigation programs to help offset volatility in commodity prices and to offset higher labor or capital costs to meet more stringent contamination standards, we cannot provide assurance that we can use these programs with our customers in all circumstances or that they will mitigate these risks in an evolving recycling environment. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. As of March 31, 2025, we were not party to any commodity hedging agreements.

The impact of commodity price risk as of March 31, 2025 does not differ materially from that discussed in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

Interest Rate Risk 

Our strategy to reduce exposure to interest rate risk involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates related to the variable rate portion of our long-term debt. We have designated these derivative instruments as highly effective cash flow hedges, and therefore the change in fair value is recorded in our stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax and included in interest expense at the same time as interest expense is affected by the hedged transactions. Differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt and included in cash flows from operating activities.

The impact of interest rate risk as of March 31, 2025 does not differ materially from that discussed in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Legal Proceedings over Certain Environmental Matters Involving Governmental Authorities with Possible Sanctions of $1,000,000 or More

Item 103 of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless we reasonably believe the monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, will not equal or exceed a specified threshold which we determine is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition. Pursuant to Item 103, we have determined such disclosure threshold to be $1,000,000. Information relating to environmental proceedings is provided in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I.
