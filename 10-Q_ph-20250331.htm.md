PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted)

  

As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "Company", "Parker", "we" or "us" refer to Parker-Hannifin Corporation and its subsidiaries.

1\. Management representation

In the opinion of the management of the Company, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position as of March 31, 2025, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 and cash flows for the nine months then ended. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Subsequent Events

The Company has evaluated subsequent events that occurred through the date these financial statements were issued. No subsequent events have occurred that required adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements.

2\. New accounting pronouncements

In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,” which requires expanded interim and annual disclosures of expense information, including the amounts of inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and depletion within commonly presented expense captions during the period. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures," which enhances the disclosure requirements for income taxes primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the Company's disclosures.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures," which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We plan to adopt the standard beginning with our fiscal 2025 Form 10-K. We expect this ASU to result in expanded disclosure of segment financial information with no impact on our financial position and results of operations.

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, "Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations," which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose information about the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. To achieve that objective, the buyer should disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its supplier finance programs, including the outstanding amount under the program, the balance sheet presentation of the outstanding amount, and a rollforward of the obligations in the program. This ASU should be adopted retrospectively for each balance sheet period presented; however, the rollforward information should be provided prospectively. The Company adopted the guidance on July 1, 2023, except for the annual rollforward requirement, which was adopted on July 1, 2024, and will be presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2025. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion.

Contract balances

Contract assets and contract liabilities are reported on a contract-by-contract basis. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. Payments from customers are received based on the terms established in the contract with the customer.

Total contract assets and contract liabilities are as follows:

Net contract liabilities at March 31, 2025 increased from the June 30, 2024 amount primarily due to timing differences between when revenue was recognized and the receipt of advance payments. During the nine months ended March 31, 2025, approximately $164 million of revenue was recognized that was included in the contract liabilities at June 30, 2024.

Remaining performance obligations

Our backlog represents written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release has been agreed to with the customer. We believe our backlog represents our unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. Backlog at March 31, 2025 was $11.0 billion, of which approximately 72 percent is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months and the balance thereafter.

4\. Divestitures

We continually assess our existing businesses and may divest those that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the Company.

During November 2024, we divested our composites and fuel containment ("CFC") business within the North America businesses of the Diversified Industrial Segment, which was acquired in the acquisition of Meggitt plc ("Meggitt"), for net proceeds of $555 million. The resulting pre-tax gain of $238 million is included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The operating results and net assets of this business were immaterial to the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.

During November 2024, we divested a non-core filtration business within the North America businesses of the Diversified Industrial Segment for proceeds of $66 million. The resulting pre-tax gain of $11 million is included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The operating results and net assets of this business were immaterial to the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.

During December 2023, we divested our Filter Resources business, which was part of the Diversified Industrial Segment, for proceeds of $37 million. The resulting pre-tax gain of $12 million is included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The operating results and net assets of the Filter Resources business were immaterial to the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.

During September 2023, we divested the MicroStrain sensing systems business, which was part of the Diversified Industrial Segment, for proceeds of $37 million. The resulting pre-tax gain of $13 million is included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The operating results and net assets of the MicroStrain sensing systems business were immaterial to the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, 199,230 and 113,956 common shares subject to equity-based awards, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of their exercise would be anti-dilutive. 

For the nine months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, 310,681 and 400,506 common shares subject to equity-based awards, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of their exercise would be anti-dilutive.

6\. Share repurchase program

The Company has a program to repurchase its common shares. On October 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the overall number of shares authorized for repurchase under the program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was 35 million. There is no limitation on the number of shares that can be repurchased in a fiscal year. There is no expiration date for this program. Repurchases may be funded primarily from operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings and the shares are initially held as treasury shares. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased 1,044,147 shares at an average price, including commissions, of $622.54 per share. During the nine months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased 1,208,732 shares at an average price, including commissions, of $620.50 per share.

7\. Trade accounts receivable, net

Trade accounts receivable are initially recorded at their net collectible amount and are generally recorded at the time the revenue from the sales transaction is recorded. We evaluate the collectibility of our receivables based on historical experience and current and forecasted economic conditions based on management's judgment. Additionally, receivables are written off to bad debt when management makes a final determination of uncollectibility. Allowance for credit losses was $12 million and $21 million at March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively.

8\. Non-trade and notes receivable

The non-trade and notes receivable caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is comprised of the following components:

10\. Supply chain financing

We have supply chain financing ("SCF") programs with financial intermediaries, which provide certain suppliers the option to be paid by the financial intermediaries earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial intermediaries and the suppliers in connection with the programs. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the SCF programs. We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the SCF programs and their participation is voluntary. 

Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF programs are included in accounts payable, trade on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and payments made under the SCF programs are included within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Accounts payable, trade included approximately $143 million and $116 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF programs as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The amounts settled through the SCF programs and paid to the participating financial intermediaries totaled $324 million and $221 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.

11\. Business realignment and acquisition integration charges

We incurred business realignment and acquisition integration charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, which included severance costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, as well as plant closures. In both fiscal 2025 and 2024, a majority of the business realignment charges were incurred in Europe.  We believe the realignment actions will positively impact future results of operations, but will not have a material effect on liquidity and sources and uses of capital.

Business realignment charges by business segment are as follows:

15\. Debt

In February 2025, the Company issued €700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.90 percent Senior Notes due March 1, 2030 (the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes will be paid annually on March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2026. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the €700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125 percent Senior Notes upon maturity in March 2025. 

Our debt portfolio included a term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). During the nine months ended March 31, 2025, we repaid the remaining principal balance of $490 million of the Term Loan Facility. Additionally, we repaid the $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes bearing interest of 3.3 percent upon maturity in November 2024. Refer to the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Commercial paper notes outstanding at March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024 were $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. 

Based on the Company’s rating level at March 31, 2025, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. At March 31, 2025, our debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.41 to 1.0. We are in compliance, and expect to remain in compliance, with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures governing certain debt securities.

16\. Income taxes

In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") published a framework, known as Pillar Two, defining a global minimum tax of 15 percent on large corporations. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. Several countries have proposed or enacted legislation to implement core elements of the Pillar Two proposal effective for years beginning after December 31, 2023, which for us is fiscal year 2025. Pillar Two does not currently have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Future legislation and guidance may result in a change to our assessment.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we completed an initiative that simplified our foreign legal entity structure. The initiative impacted our evaluation of certain foreign tax loss carryforwards whose realizability was previously considered to be remote. This led to a valuation allowance release and the recording of a $180 million discrete tax benefit.

Unrecognized tax benefits reflect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns and the amounts reflected in the financial statements. As of March 31, 2025, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $82 million, all of which, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The accrued interest and accrued penalties related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluded from the amount above, is $22 million and $2 million, respectively. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to approximately $30 million as a result of the revaluation of existing uncertain tax positions arising from developments in the examination process or the closure of tax statutes. Any increase in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is expected to be insignificant.

We file income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. We are open to assessment on our U.S. federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years after 2013, and our state and local returns for fiscal years after 2018. We are also open to assessment for significant foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years after 2011.

17\. Financial instruments

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and long-term investments, as well as obligations under accounts payable, trade, notes payable and long-term debt. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, trade and notes payable approximate fair value. 

The carrying value of long-term debt, which excludes the impact of net unamortized debt issuance costs, and estimated fair value of long-term debt are as follows:                                                                                                                         
                                          March 31,2025             June 30,2024  
Carrying value of long-term debt          $              7,483,808                           $  8,469,739    
Estimated fair value of long-term debt    7,082,399                               7,884,556     

The fair value of long-term debt is classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

We utilize derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges, to manage foreign currency transaction and translation risk. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions, and we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

In February 2025, the Company issued €700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.90 percent Senior Notes due 2030. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the €700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125 percent Senior Notes due 2025. The Company’s €700 million aggregate principal amount of Notes have been designated as a hedge of the Company’s net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The effect of translating the Notes into U.S. dollars is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. 

The location and fair value of derivative financial instruments reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows:

The cross-currency swap and forward exchange contracts are reflected on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have not entered into any master netting arrangements.

The €69 million, €290 million and ¥2.1 billion of cross-currency swap contracts have been designated as hedging instruments. The forward exchange contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and are considered to be economic hedges of forecasted transactions.

The forward exchange contracts are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses in other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Derivatives designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of the €69 million, €290 million and ¥2.1 billion of cross-currency swap contracts designated as hedging instruments using the spot method. Under this method, the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense.

  

Gains (losses) on derivative financial instruments that were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows:

Derivatives consist of forward exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, the fair values of which are calculated using market observable inputs including both spot and forward prices for the same underlying currencies. The calculation of the fair value of the cross-currency swap contracts also utilizes a present value cash flow model.

The primary investment objective for all derivatives is to manage foreign currency transaction and translation risk.

There are no other financial assets or financial liabilities that are marked to market on a recurring basis.

Over the long term, the extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by global economic and political uncertainty, geopolitical risks and public health crises depends on future developments that remain uncertain. We will continue to monitor the global environment and manage our business with the goal to minimize unfavorable impacts on operations and financial results.

  

On February 9, 2025, a fire damaged a portion of our Saegertown, Pennsylvania facility, causing a pause in production. Some production and operations were re-established within days of the event and global resources have been deployed to restore capacity to minimize customer disruption. Full capacity is expected to be restored during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. There was no material impact as a result of this disruption during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and none are expected during future periods. 

  

We maintain third-party insurance coverage for property damage, clean-up, replacement and business interruption, subject to an $8 million deductible and liability retention for the event, which was recorded in other income, net during the third quarter. While we expect to be reimbursed for a significant portion of our business interruption impacts by our third-party insurance coverage, we will not record any associated gain until realized.

Net sales decreased in the current-year quarter due to lower sales in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by higher sales in the Aerospace Systems Segment. The effect of currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales during the current-year quarter by approximately $57 million, which was primarily attributable to the Diversified Industrial Segment. The impact of divestiture activity decreased net sales by approximately $105 million during the current-year quarter.

Net sales decreased in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 due to lower sales in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by higher sales in the Aerospace Systems Segment. The effect of currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 by approximately $105 million, of which $110 million was attributable to the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by an increase of $5 million in the Aerospace Systems Segment. The impact of divestiture activity decreased net sales by approximately $180 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2025.

Gross profit margin (calculated as net sales minus cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025 due to higher margins in both segments primarily resulting from price increases, favorable product mix and cost containment, as well as benefits from prior-year business realignment activities, partially offset by decreased volume within the Diversified Industrial Segment.

Cost of sales also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $5 million and $4 million for the current and prior-year quarter, respectively, and $21 million for both the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 2024.

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") decreased in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily due to lower research and development expenses and benefits from prior-year restructuring and acquisition-integration activities, as well as cost containment. In the first nine months of fiscal 2025 lower intangible asset amortization also contributed to the decrease in SG&A.

SG&A also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $11 million and $16 million for the current and prior-year quarter, respectively, and $37 million and $42 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Interest expense decreased during the current-year quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily due to lower average debt outstanding.

Other income, net included the following:

Foreign currency transaction loss (gain) primarily relates to the impact of exchange rates on intercompany transactions, forward contracts, cash, as well as accounts and notes payables and receivables. (Gain) loss on disposal of assets and divestitures during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily relates to the divestiture of the composites and fuel containment ("CFC") business. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

  

Effective tax rate for the current-year quarter of fiscal 2025 was lower than the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21 percent due to tax benefits from the release of a foreign valuation allowance, share-based compensation, and foreign-derived intangible income, which were partially offset by U.S. state and local taxes and taxes related to international activities. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

  

The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was lower than the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21 percent for the same reasons as those listed above for the current-year quarter, plus a tax benefit from a lower taxable gain on divestitures than gain under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

  

The effective tax rate for the comparable prior-year periods was equal to the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21 percent due to tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income, which were offset by U.S. state and local taxes and taxes related to international activities.

  

The fiscal 2025 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 16 percent.

1This table reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with GAAP to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of divestitures for 12 months after their completion as well as changes in currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure). The effects of divestitures and changes in currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period. 

Net Sales

Diversified Industrial Segment sales decreased $277 million and $701 million from the prior-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately $54 million and $110 million in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively. The impact of divestiture activity decreased sales by approximately $105 million and $180 million in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively. Excluding the effects of the changes in currency exchange rates and divestiture activity, sales decreased $118 million and $411 million from the prior-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024, respectively.

North America businesses \- Sales decreased $201 million and $512 million from the prior-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately $17 million and $37 million in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively. The effects of divestiture activity decreased sales by approximately $105 million and $180 million in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and divestiture activity, sales in the North America businesses decreased $78 million and $296 million in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively. In the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, the decrease in sales is primarily due to lower demand from end users in the in-plant and industrial equipment, off-highway, transportation and energy markets, partially offset by an increase in end-user demand in the HVAC and refrigeration and aerospace and defense markets.

International businesses \- Sales decreased $76 million and $189 million from the prior-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately $37 million and $73 million in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, sales in the International businesses decreased $40 million and $115 million in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively. In both the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, this decrease in sales was due to lower sales in Europe, partially offset by an increase in sales in the Asia Pacific region and Latin America. 

Within Europe, sales in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025 decreased primarily due to lower demand from end users across the in-plant and industrial equipment, off-highway and transportation markets.

Within the Asia Pacific region, sales in the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025 increased primarily due to higher end-user demand in the electronics and semiconductor and in-plant and industrial equipment markets, partially offset by lower demand from end users in the transportation, energy and off-highway markets. 

Within Latin America, sales in the current-year quarter increased primarily due to higher end-user demand in the in-plant and industrial equipment, off-highway and transportation markets, partially offset by lower demand from end users in the energy market. In the first nine months of fiscal 2025, sales increased primarily due to higher end-user demand in the in-plant and industrial equipment, transportation, off-highway and energy markets.

Operating Margin

Diversified Industrial Segment operating margin increased during the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025 in both the North America and International businesses due to favorable product mix, price increases and benefits related to prior- year restructuring activities as well as cost containment, partially offset by decreased sales volume. Also, during the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, operating margin in the North America businesses benefited from divestiture activity.

Business Realignment

The following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in the Diversified Industrial Segment operating income:

The business realignment charges primarily consist of severance costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, as well as plant closures. Acquisition integration charges relate to the acquisition of Meggitt plc ("Meggitt"). Business realignment and acquisition integration charges within the International businesses were primarily incurred in Europe.

We anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 will not materially impact operating income in fiscal 2025 and will increase operating income by approximately two percent in fiscal 2026 for both the North America and International businesses. We expect to continue to take actions necessary to appropriately structure the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment. We currently anticipate incurring approximately $20 million of additional business realignment charges in the remainder of fiscal 2025. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.

Backlog

Diversified Industrial Segment backlog, as of March 31, 2025, decreased from the prior-year quarter. Approximately 95 percent of the decrease in backlog was related to the CFC divestiture in the North America businesses. Approximately five percent of the decrease was due to shipments exceeding orders in the International businesses. Within the International businesses, Latin America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region accounted for approximately 60 percent, 30 percent and 10 percent of the decrease, respectively. 

Diversified Industrial Segment backlog decreased from the June 30, 2024 amount of $4.2 billion. The decrease in backlog was related to the CFC divestiture in the North America businesses, partially offset by an increase in backlog in the International businesses. Within the International businesses, the increase in backlog from the June 30, 2024 amount was primarily attributable to Europe and the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by a decrease in backlog in Latin America.

Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.

Net Sales

Aerospace Systems Segment sales increased in both the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily due to higher volume in the commercial and defense aftermarket. Higher volume in the commercial and defense original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") market segments also contributed to the sales increase.

Operating Margin

Aerospace Systems Segment operating margin increased during both the current-year quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025 due to higher sales volume and favorable aftermarket mix, as well as benefits from cost containment initiatives and prior-year acquisition integration activities. 

Business Realignment

Within the Aerospace Systems Segment, we incurred acquisition integration and business realignment charges of $3 million and $12 million in the current and prior-year quarter, respectively, and $16 million and $27 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. We do not expect to incur material business realignment and acquisition integration charges in the remainder of fiscal 2025. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.

Cash flows from financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 2024 were impacted by the following factors:

•Net commercial paper repayments of $213 million in fiscal 2025 compared to net commercial paper repayments of $941 million in fiscal 2024.

•Principal payments totaling $490 million related to borrowings under the term loan facility ("Term Loan Facility") in fiscal 2025 compared to principal payments totaling $250 million related to the Term Loan Facility in fiscal 2024. 

•Aggregate principal payment of $500 million related to the maturity of medium-term notes during fiscal 2025.

•Repurchases under the Company's share repurchase program amounted to 1.2 million common shares for $750 million during fiscal 2025, compared to 0.3 million common shares for $149 million during fiscal 2024.

•Issuance of €700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.90 percent Senior Notes due 2030 (the "Notes") for which the proceeds were used to repay the €700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125 percent Senior Notes due 2025 in fiscal 2025.

Cash Requirements

We are actively monitoring our liquidity position and remain focused on managing our inventory and other working capital requirements. We are continuing to target two percent of sales for capital expenditures and are prioritizing those related to safety, strategic investments and sustainability initiatives. We believe that cash generated from operations and our commercial paper program will satisfy our operating needs for the foreseeable future.

Dividends

We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.63 per share on January 23, 2025, which was paid on March 7, 2025. Dividends have been paid for 299 consecutive quarters. Additionally, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.80 per share on April 24, 2025, payable on June 6, 2025, increasing our annual dividend per share paid to shareholders for 69 consecutive fiscal years.

Share Repurchases

The Company has a program to repurchase its common shares. On October 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the overall number of shares authorized to repurchase under the program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was 35 million. There is no limitation on the number of shares that can be repurchased in a year. Repurchases may be funded primarily from operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings and the shares are initially held as treasury shares. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of share repurchases.

Liquidity

Cash, comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments, includes $329 million and $311 million held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries at March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company does not permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. The distribution of these earnings could result in non-federal U.S. or foreign taxes. All other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested.

We are currently authorized to sell up to $3.0 billion of short-term commercial paper notes. As of March 31, 2025, $1.9 billion of commercial paper notes were outstanding, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the current-year quarter was $2.2 billion.

The Company has a line of credit totaling $3.0 billion through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, of which $1.1 billion was available as of March 31, 2025. Advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. The credit agreement supports our commercial paper program, and issuances of commercial paper reduce the amount of credit available under the credit agreement. The credit agreement expires in June 2028; however, the Company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which is dependent upon the Company’s credit ratings. Although a lowering of the Company’s credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the Company’s ability to use the credit agreement, nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings.

We primarily utilize unsecured medium-term notes and senior notes to meet our financing needs and we expect to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Refer to the Cash flows from financing activities section above and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

In February 2025, the Company issued €700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.90 percent Senior Notes due March 1, 2030. Interest on the Notes will be paid annually on March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2026. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the €700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125 percent Senior Notes upon maturity in March 2025. Refer to Notes 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Our debt portfolio included a Term Loan Facility. During the nine months ended March 31, 2025, we repaid the remaining principal balance of $490 million of the Term Loan Facility. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The Company’s credit agreement and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. Based on the Company’s rating level at March 31, 2025, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. At March 31, 2025, the Company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.41 to 1.0. We are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures.

Our goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. The rating agencies periodically update the Company's credit ratings as events occur. At March 31, 2025, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows:

                                                      
Fitch Ratings                       A-    
Moody's Investors Services, Inc.    A3    
Standard & Poor's                   BBB+  

Supply Chain Financing

We continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which include the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. We have supply chain financing programs with financial intermediaries, which provide certain suppliers the option to be paid by the financial intermediaries earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Strategic Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the Company’s strong financial position. In addition, we will continue to assess our existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the Company. On July 28, 2024, the Company signed an agreement to divest its CFC business within the North America businesses of the Diversified Industrial Segment, which was acquired as part of the Meggitt acquisition. This divestiture closed on November 1, 2024 for net proceeds of $555 million. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Additionally, we divested a non-core filtration business within the North America businesses of the Diversified Industrial Segment for proceeds of $66 million on November 1, 2024.

Forward-Looking Statements

  

Forward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. Often but not always, these statements may be identified from the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “expects,” “targets,” “is likely,” “will,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, and include all statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments. Neither Parker nor any of its respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur. Parker cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from past performance or current expectations. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.

  

Among other factors which may affect future performance are:

  

•changes in business relationships with and orders by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments; 

•disputes regarding contract terms, changes in contract costs and revenue estimates for new development programs; 

•changes in product mix; 

•ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; 

•uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions; 

•ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures; 

•the determination and ability to successfully undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs, including cost savings, thereof; 

•ability to implement successfully business and operating initiatives, including the timing, price and execution of share repurchases and other capital initiatives; 

•availability, cost increases of or other limitations on our access to raw materials, component products and/or commodities if associated costs cannot be recovered in product pricing; 

•ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits; 

•legal and regulatory developments and other government actions, including related to environmental protection, and associated compliance costs; 

•supply chain and labor disruptions, including as a result of tariffs and labor shortages; 

•threats associated with international conflicts and cybersecurity risks and risks associated with protecting our intellectual property; 

•uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals; 

•effects on market conditions, including sales and pricing, resulting from global reactions to U.S. trade policies; 

•manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability;

•inability to obtain, or meet conditions imposed for, required governmental and regulatory approvals; 

•changes in the tax laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions and judicial or regulatory interpretations thereof; and 

•large scale disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, industrial accidents and pandemics.

  

Readers should consider these forward-looking statements in light of risk factors discussed in Parker’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and other periodic filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

  

The Company makes these statements as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.

  

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

  

A substantial portion of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies, which are also their functional currencies. Foreign currency exposures arise from the translation of foreign currency-denominated assets and 

\- 29 -

* * *

  

liabilities into U.S. dollars and from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. We continue to manage the associated foreign currency transaction and translation risk using existing processes.

The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For cross-currency swap contracts measured using the spot method, the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense. The translation of the foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

The Company’s debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, consisting of commercial paper, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Term Loan Facility, which had a variable interest rate, was repaid as of December 31, 2024. Our objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting our exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt, consisting of weighted-average commercial paper borrowings for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, by approximately $18 million.

  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

  

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025. Based on this evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2025, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
