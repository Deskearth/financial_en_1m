(4) Segment Data

The Company’s operations are aggregated into two reportable business segments as follows:

Marine Transportation Segment (“KMT”) — Provides marine transportation by United States flagged vessels principally of liquid cargoes throughout the United States inland waterway system, along all three United States coasts, and to a lesser extent, in United States coastal transportation of dry-bulk cargoes. The principal products transported include petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals.

Distribution and Services Segment (“KDS”) — Provides after-market services and genuine replacement parts for engines, transmissions, reduction gears, electric motors, drives, and controls, specialized electrical distribution and control systems, and related equipment used in oilfield services, marine, power generation, on-highway, and other industrial applications. The Company also rents equipment including generators, industrial compressors, high-capacity lift trucks, construction equipment and refrigeration trailers for use in a variety of industrial markets. The Company also manufactures and remanufactures specialized equipment, including pressure pumping units, electric power generation equipment, and specialized electrical distribution and control equipment for oilfield service, railroad and other industrial customers.

The Company’s two reportable business segments are managed separately by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), its Chief Executive Officer, based on fundamental differences in their operations. The Company’s accounting policies for the business segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on the contributions to operating income of the respective segments, and before income taxes, interest, gains or losses on disposition of assets, other nonoperating income, noncontrolling interests, accounting changes, and nonrecurring items. The CODM uses segment operating income to allocate resources for each segment during the annual budget and forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis for segment operating income when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments. The CODM also uses segment operating income to assess the performance for each segment by comparing the results and return on invested capital of each segment. Intersegment revenues, based on market-based pricing, of KDS from KMT of $11.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and $6.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as well as the related intersegment profit of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, have been eliminated from the tables below.

The following tables set forth the Company’s revenues, depreciation and amortization, and income or loss by reportable segment and total assets (in thousands):

(a)

Variable interest rate of 5.6% at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

On July 29, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2027 Credit Agreement”) with a group of commercial banks, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the administrative agent bank that allows for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2027 Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $250 million unsecured term loan (the “2027 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of July 29, 2027. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company repaid $80 million under the 2027 Term Loan prior to scheduled maturities. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $100 million under the 2027 Term Loan prior to scheduled maturities. As a result, no repayments are required until March 31, 2027. Future repayments under the 2027 Term Loan are excluded from short term liabilities because the Company intends to use availability under the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility to repay these amounts upon maturity. Outstanding letters of credit under the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility were $6,000 and available borrowing capacity was $275.0 million as of March 31, 2025.

On February 3, 2022, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement for the issuance of $300 million of unsecured senior notes with a group of institutional investors, consisting of $60 million of 3.46% series A notes (“Series A Notes”) and $240 million of 3.51% series B notes (“Series B Notes”), each due January 19, 2033 (collectively, the “2033 Notes”). The Series A Notes were issued on October 20, 2022, and the Series B Notes were issued on January 19, 2023. No principal payments will be required until maturity.

The Company has a $15 million line of credit (“Credit Line”) with Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”) for short-term liquidity needs and letters of credit, with a maturity date of June 30, 2026. Outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Line were $6.8 million and available borrowing capacity was $8.2 million as of March 31, 2025.

(6) Leases

The Company currently leases various facilities and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases. The accounting for the Company’s leases may require judgments, which include determining whether a contract contains a lease, allocating the consideration between lease and non-lease components, and determining the incremental borrowing rates. Leases with an initial noncancelable term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has also elected to combine lease and non-lease components on all classes of leased assets, except for leased towing vessels, for which the Company estimates approximately 70% of the costs relate to service costs and other non-lease components. Variable lease costs relate primarily to real estate executory costs (i.e. taxes, insurance and maintenance).

Future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands):

(11) Retirement Plans

The Company sponsors a defined benefit plan for certain of its inland vessel personnel and shore based tankermen. The plan benefits are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation. The plan assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities.

On April 12, 2017, the Company amended its pension plan to cease all benefit accruals for periods after May 31, 2017 for certain participants. Participants grandfathered and not impacted were those, as of the close of business on May 31, 2017, who either (a) had completed 15 years of pension service or (b) had attained age 50 and completed 10 years of pension service. Participants non-grandfathered are eligible to receive discretionary 401(k) plan contributions.

The Company’s pension plan funding strategy is to make annual contributions in amounts equal to or greater than amounts necessary to meet minimum government funding requirements. The plan’s benefit obligations are based on a variety of demographic and economic assumptions, and the pension plan assets’ returns are subject to various risks, including market and interest rate risk, making an accurate prediction of the pension plan contribution difficult. Based on current pension plan assets and market conditions, the Company does not expect to make a contribution to the Kirby pension plan during 2025.

On February 14, 2018, with the acquisition of Higman Marine, Inc. and its affiliated companies (“Higman”), the Company assumed Higman’s pension plan for its inland vessel personnel and office staff. On March 27, 2018, the Company amended the Higman pension plan to close it to all new entrants and cease all benefit accruals for periods after May 15, 2018 for all participants. The Company made contributions of $0.3 million to the Higman pension plan during the three months ended March 31, 2025. The Company expects to make additional contributions of $0.9 million during the remainder of 2025.

The Company sponsors an unfunded defined benefit health care plan that provides limited postretirement medical benefits to employees who meet minimum age and service requirements, and to eligible dependents. The plan is contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The plan eliminated coverage for future retirees as of December 31, 2011. The Company also has an unfunded defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) that was assumed in an acquisition in 1999. That plan ceased to accrue additional benefits effective January 1, 2000.

(13) Contingencies and Commitments

On October 13, 2016, the tug Nathan E. Stewart and barge DBL 55, an articulated tank barge and tugboat unit (“ATB”) owned and operated by Kirby Offshore Marine, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, ran aground at the entrance to Seaforth Channel on Atholone Island, British Columbia. The grounding resulted in a breach of a portion of the Nathan E. Stewart’s fuel tanks causing a discharge of diesel fuel into the water. The United States Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board designated the Company as a party of interest in their investigation as to the cause of the incident. The Canadian authorities including Transport Canada and the Canadian Transportation Safety Board investigated the cause of the incident. On October 10, 2018, the Heiltsuk First Nation filed a civil action in the British Columbia Supreme Court against a subsidiary of the Company, the master and pilot of the tug, the vessels and the Canadian government seeking unquantified damages as a result of the incident. On May 1, 2019, the Company filed a limitation action in the Federal Court of Canada seeking limitation of liability relating to the incident as provided under admiralty law. The Heiltsuk First Nation’s civil claim has been consolidated into the Federal Court limitation action as of July 26, 2019 and it is expected that the Federal Court of Canada will decide all claims against the Company. The Company is unable to estimate the potential exposure in the civil proceeding. The Company has various insurance policies covering liabilities including pollution, property, marine and general liability and believes that it has satisfactory insurance coverage for the cost of cleanup and salvage operations as well as other potential liabilities arising from the incident. The Company believes its accrual of such estimated liability is adequate for the incident and does not expect the incident to have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition.

In addition, the Company is involved in various legal and other proceedings which are incidental to the conduct of its business, none of which in the opinion of management will have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Management believes its accrual of such estimated liability is adequate and believes that it has adequate insurance coverage or has meritorious defenses for these other claims and contingencies.

The Company has issued guaranties or obtained standby letters of credit and performance bonds supporting performance by the Company and its subsidiaries of contractual or contingent legal obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate notional value of these instruments is $32.8 million at March 31, 2025, including $11.6 million in letters of credit and $21.1 million in performance bonds. All of these instruments have an expiration date within two years. The Company does not believe demand for payment under these instruments is likely and expects no material cash outlays to occur regarding these instruments.

Overview

The Company is the nation’s largest domestic tank barge operator transporting bulk liquid products throughout the Mississippi River System, on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and coastwise along all three United States coasts. The Company transports petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals by tank barge. In addition, the Company participates in the transportation of dry-bulk commodities in United States coastwise trade. Through KDS, the Company provides after-market services and genuine replacement parts for engines, transmissions, reduction gears, electric motors, drives, and controls, specialized electrical distribution and control systems, and related equipment used in oilfield services, marine, power generation, on-highway, and other industrial applications. The Company also rents equipment including generators, industrial compressors, high-capacity lift trucks, construction equipment and refrigeration trailers for use in a variety of industrial markets. The Company also manufactures and remanufactures specialized equipment, including pressure pumping units, electric power generation equipment, and specialized electrical distribution and control equipment for oilfield service, railroad and other industrial customers.

The following table summarizes key operating results of the Company (in thousands, except per share amounts):

                                                                                                                                           
                                                                              Three Months Ended March 31,

Cash provided by operating activities for the 2025 first quarter decreased in comparison to the 2024 first quarter primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes. This was related to an increase in inventories in the first quarter of 2025 due to the impact of supply delays in KDS resulting in the buildup of inventory for projects, mainly due to power generation orders, that are scheduled to be delivered later in 2025, partially offset by increased net earnings. For the 2025 first quarter, capital expenditures of $78.7 million included $61.8 million in KMT and $16.9 million in KDS and corporate, each more fully described under Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures below.

The Company projects that capital expenditures for 2025 will be in the $280 million to $320 million range. Approximately $180 million to $220 million is associated with marine maintenance capital and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment, and facility improvements. Approximately $100 million is associated with growth capital spending in both segments.

The Company’s debt-to-capitalization ratio increased to 24.8% at March 31, 2025 compared to 20.7% at December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in debt outstanding. Total equity at March 31, 2025 decreased as compared to December 31, 2024 primarily from treasury stock purchases of $101.5 million, partially offset by net earnings attributable to Kirby of $76.0 million. The Company’s debt outstanding as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 is detailed in Long-Term Financing below.

Marine Transportation

For the 2025 first quarter, KMT generated 61% of the Company’s revenues compared to 59% for the 2024 first quarter. The segment’s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies that operate in the United States. Products transported include intermediate materials used to produce many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers — plastics, fiber, paints, detergents, oil additives and paper, among others, as well as residual fuel oil, ship bunkers, asphalt, gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, crude oil, natural gas condensate, and agricultural chemicals. Consequently, KMT is directly affected by the volumes produced by the Company’s petroleum, petrochemical, and refining customer base.

The following table summarizes the Company’s marine transportation fleet:

Offshore tugboats and docking tugboat (owned and chartered)               4                5        

The Company also owns shifting operations and fleeting facilities for dry cargo barges and tank barges in the Houston Ship Channel and in Freeport and Port Arthur, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana and a shipyard for building towboats and performing routine maintenance near the Houston Ship Channel. Furthermore, the Company owns a two-thirds interest in Osprey Line, L.L.C., which transports project cargoes and cargo containers by barge.

During the 2025 first quarter, the Company purchased 14 inland tank barges, chartered five inland tank barges, and retired two inland tank barges, increasing its capacity by approximately 0.4 million barrels.

KMT revenues for the 2025 first quarter were flat and operating income increased 4% compared to the 2024 first quarter. Revenues were flat in the 2025 first quarter as compared to the 2024 first quarter as higher term and spot market pricing in the inland and coastal markets was offset by lower fuel rebills in both markets and increased shipyards in the coastal market as compared to the 2024 first quarter. The increase in operating income for the 2025 first quarter was primarily due to higher term and spot pricing in the inland and coastal markets, partially offset by higher levels of planned coastal shipyards and increased inland delay days in the 2025 first quarter. The 2025 and 2024 first quarters were impacted by poor operating conditions including seasonal wind and fog along the Gulf Coast and various lock closures. For the 2025 first quarter, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 82% and the coastal fleet contributed 18% of KMT revenues. For the 2024 first quarter, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 81% and the coastal fleet contributed 19% of KMT revenues.

Inland tank barge utilization levels averaged in the low to mid-90% range during both the 2025 and 2024 first quarters. The 2025 and 2024 first quarters were impacted by high winds and heavy fog along the Gulf Coast and lock delays. Coastal tank barge utilization levels averaged in the mid to high 90% range during both the 2025 and 2024 first quarters.

During the 2025 first quarter, approximately 70% of KMT inland revenues were under term contracts and 30% were spot contract revenues. During the 2024 first quarter, approximately 65% of KMT inland revenues were under term contracts and 35% were spot contract revenues. Inland time charters during the 2025 first quarter represented approximately 61% of inland revenues under term contracts compared with 62% in the 2024 first quarter. During the 2025 first quarter, approximately 100% of KMT coastal revenues were under term contracts and none were under spot contracts. During the 2024 first quarter, approximately 96% of KMT coastal revenues were under term contracts and 4% were under spot contracts. Coastal time charters represented approximately 100% of coastal revenues under term contracts during the 2025 first quarter compared to 98% during the 2024 first quarter. Term contracts have contract terms of 12 months or longer, while spot contracts have contract terms of less than 12 months.

The following table summarizes the average range of pricing changes in term and spot contracts renewed during 2025 compared to contracts renewed during the corresponding quarter of 2024:

Spot increase          18% – 20%           

(a)

Spot and term contract pricing in the coastal market are contingent on various factors including geographic location, vessel capacity, vessel type, and product serviced.

Effective January 1, 2025, annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland multi-year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts in the 3% to 5% range, excluding fuel.

KMT operating margin was 18.2% for the 2025 first quarter compared to 17.5% for the 2024 first quarter.

Distribution and Services

The Company, through KDS, provides after-market services and genuine replacement parts for engines, transmissions, reduction gears, electric motors, drives, and controls, specialized electrical distribution and control systems, and related equipment used in oilfield services, marine, power generation, on-highway, and other industrial applications. The Company also rents equipment including generators, industrial compressors, high-capacity lift trucks, construction equipment and refrigeration trailers for use in a variety of industrial markets. The Company also manufactures and remanufactures specialized equipment, including pressure pumping units, electric power generation equipment, and specialized electrical distribution and control equipment for oilfield service, railroad and other industrial customers.

For the 2025 first quarter, KDS generated 39% of the Company’s revenues, of which 88% were generated from service and parts and 12% from manufacturing. The results of KDS are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the oil and gas, marine, power generation, on-highway, and other related industrial markets.

KDS revenues for the 2025 first quarter decreased 7% and operating income increased 3% compared with the 2024 first quarter. In the commercial and industrial market, revenues and operating income increased compared to the 2024 first quarter as higher business levels in marine repair were partially offset by lower on-highway activity. For the 2025 first quarter, the commercial and industrial market contributed 52% of KDS revenues.

In the power generation market, revenues and operating income decreased compared to the 2024 first quarter as deferred deliveries of equipment due to supply delays impacted 2025 first quarter results. For the 2025 first quarter, the power generation market contributed 34% of KDS revenues.

In the oil and gas market, revenues decreased and operating income increased compared to the 2024 first quarter with revenues impacted by lower levels of conventional oilfield activity which resulted in decreased demand for new transmissions and parts, partially offset by deliveries of electric fracturing equipment. Operating income increased in the 2025 first quarter as compared to the 2024 first quarter due to product mix and ongoing cost management initiatives. For the 2025 first quarter, the oil and gas market contributed 14% of KDS revenues.

KDS operating margin was 7.3% for the 2025 first quarter compared to 6.6% for the 2024 first quarter.

Outlook

Overall, the Company expects to deliver improved financial results in 2025. In KMT, barge utilization and customer demand remain favorable and rates continue to increase. In KDS, growth in the power generation market is expected to mostly offset softness in oil and gas markets, and the on-highway service and repair business due to the ongoing trucking recession. The Company remains mindful of the ever-changing economic landscape related to the possible impact of high interest rates, tariffs and possible recessionary headwinds as it moves through 2025.

In the inland marine transportation market in 2025, the Company anticipates positive market dynamics due to limited new barge construction. The Company expects barge utilization rates to remain steady for the year with continued improvement in term contract pricing as renewals occur throughout the year. However, the Company continues to see inflationary pressures and there remains an acute mariner shortage in the industry which continues to drive up labor costs. These pressures, along with the increasing cost of equipment, should continue to put upward pressure on spot and term contract prices. In the coastal marine transportation market in 2025, market conditions remain very favorable with steady customer demand. This is expected to keep barge utilization at high levels with improved rates as the availability of equipment is limited across the industry given there are currently no new ATBs under construction.

The Company expects mixed results in KDS in 2025 as near-term volatility from supply issues, customers deferring maintenance, and lower overall levels of activity in the oil and gas market are partially offset by increased orders in the power generation market. In commercial and industrial, the demand outlook in marine repair remains steady while on-highway service and repair remains soft. In power generation, the Company anticipates continued strong growth in orders as data center demand and the need for backup power continues to be strong. In oil and gas, the Company expects revenues to be down as the transition from conventional diesel hydraulic fracturing to electric hydraulic fracturing continues to take place. The Company anticipates extended lead times and supply delays for certain original equipment manufacturer products to continue throughout 2025.

Acquisitions

On March 27, 2025, the Company purchased 14 inland tank barges with a total capacity of 364,000 barrels, including four specialty barges, and four high horsepower towboats from an undisclosed seller for $97.3 million in cash. The 14 tank barges, including four specialty barges, transport petrochemicals and refined products on the Mississippi River System and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The average age of the 14 barges was 16 years.

On December 31, 2024, the Company purchased an inland tank barge from a leasing company for $2.7 million in cash. The Company had been leasing the barge prior to purchase.

On December 30, 2024, the Company purchased three inland tank barges from an undisclosed seller for $9.9 million in cash.

On May 15, 2024, the Company completed the purchase of 13 inland tank barges, with a total capacity of 347,000 barrels, and two high horsepower towboats from an undisclosed seller for $65.2 million in cash. The 13 tank barges, including three specialty barges, transport petrochemicals and refined products on the Mississippi River System and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The average age of the 13 barges was 15 years.

Financing of these purchases was through borrowings under the Company’s 2027 Revolving Credit Facility and cash provided by operating activities.

KMT revenues for the 2025 first quarter were flat and operating income increased 4% compared to the 2024 first quarter. Revenues were flat in the 2025 first quarter as compared to the 2024 first quarter as higher term and spot market pricing in the inland and coastal markets was offset by lower fuel rebills in both markets and increased shipyards in the coastal market as compared to the 2024 first quarter. The increase in operating income for the 2025 first quarter was primarily due to higher term and spot pricing in the inland and coastal markets, partially offset by higher levels of planned coastal shipyards and increased inland delay days in the 2025 first quarter. The 2025 and 2024 first quarters were impacted by poor operating conditions including seasonal wind and fog along the Gulf Coast and various lock closures. For the 2025 first quarter, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 82% and the coastal fleet contributed 18% of KMT revenues. For the 2024 first quarter, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 81% and the coastal fleet contributed 19% of KMT revenues.

Inland tank barge utilization levels averaged in the low to mid-90% range during both the 2025 and 2024 first quarters. The 2025 and 2024 first quarters were impacted by high winds and heavy fog along the Gulf Coast and lock delays. Coastal tank barge utilization levels averaged in the mid to high 90% range during both the 2025 and 2024 first quarters.

The petrochemical market, which is the Company’s largest market, contributed 50% of KMT revenues for the 2025 first quarter reflecting steady rates, volumes and utilization from Gulf Coast petrochemical plants as compared to the 2024 first quarter.

The black oil market, which contributed 25% of KMT revenues for the 2025 first quarter reflected stable demand as refinery utilization and production levels of refined petroleum products and fuel oils increased. During the 2025 first quarter, the Company transported crude oil and natural gas condensate produced from major U.S. shale basins along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway with inland vessels and in the Gulf of America with coastal equipment. Additionally, the Company transported volumes of Utica natural gas condensate downriver from the Mid-Atlantic to the Gulf Coast.

* * *

The refined petroleum products market, which contributed 22% of KMT revenues for the 2025 first quarter, reflected stable volumes in the inland market with steady refinery utilization and product levels as compared to the 2024 first quarter.

The agricultural chemical market, which contributed 3% of KMT revenues for the 2025 first quarter reflected stable demand for transportation of both domestically produced and imported products as compared to the 2024 first quarter.

For the 2025 first quarter, inland operations incurred 4,029 delay days, 15% more than the 3,507 delay days that occurred during the 2024 first quarter. Delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow (towboat and one or more tank barges) during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather, lock conditions, or other navigational factors. Delay days reflected poor operating conditions due to heavy wind and fog along the Gulf Coast and lock delays during the 2025 and 2024 first quarters.

During the 2025 first quarter, approximately 70% of KMT inland revenues were under term contracts and 30% were spot contract revenues. During the 2024 first quarter, approximately 65% of KMT inland revenues were under term contracts and 35% were spot contract revenues. Inland time charters during the 2025 first quarter represented approximately 61% of inland revenues under term contracts compared with 62% in the 2024 first quarter. During the 2025 first quarter, approximately 100% of KMT coastal revenues were under term contracts and none were under spot contracts. During the 2024 first quarter, approximately 96% of KMT coastal revenues were under term contracts and 4% were under spot contracts. Coastal time charters represented approximately 100% of coastal revenues under term contracts during the 2025 first quarter compared to 98% during the 2024 first quarter. Term contracts have contract terms of 12 months or longer, while spot contracts have contract terms of less than 12 months.

The following table summarizes the average range of pricing changes in term and spot contracts renewed during 2025 compared to contracts renewed during the corresponding quarter of 2024:

(a)

Spot and term contract pricing in the coastal market are contingent on various factors including geographic location, vessel capacity, vessel type, and product serviced.

Effective January 1, 2025, annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland multi-year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts in the 3% to 5% range, excluding fuel.

Marine Transportation Costs and Expenses

Costs and expenses for both the 2025 first quarter decreased 1% compared to the 2024 first quarter. Costs of sales and operating expenses for the 2025 first quarter decreased 3% compared with the 2024 first quarter. The decrease during the 2025 first quarter was driven by lower fuel costs, partially offset by inflationary cost pressures including wage increases that went into effect in 2024.

The inland marine transportation fleet operated an average of 291 towboats during the 2025 first quarter, of which an average of 76 were chartered, compared to 286 during the 2024 first quarter, of which an average of 72 were chartered. The Company charters in or releases chartered towboats in an effort to balance horsepower needs with current requirements, taking into account variability in demand or anticipated demand, addition or removal of tank barges from the fleet, chartered towboat availability, and weather or water conditions. The Company has historically used chartered towboats for approximately one-fourth of its horsepower requirements.

During the 2025 first quarter, inland operations consumed 11.7 million gallons of diesel fuel compared to 11.9 million gallons consumed during the 2024 first quarter. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed during the 2025 first quarter was $2.57 per gallon compared with $2.82 per gallon for the 2024 first quarter. Fuel escalation and de-escalation clauses are typically included in term contracts and are designed to rebate fuel costs when prices decline and recover additional fuel costs when fuel prices rise; however, there is generally a 30 to 120 day delay before contracts are adjusted. Spot contracts do not have escalators for fuel.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the 2025 first quarter increased 9% compared to the 2024 first quarter. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the 2025 first quarter as compared to the 2024 first quarter was primarily due to salary and wage increases that went into effect on July 1, 2024, continued inflationary cost pressures, and an increase in the provision for credit losses related to a certain customer.

Marine Transportation Operating Income and Operating Margin

KMT operating income for the 2025 first quarter increased 4% compared with the 2024 first quarter. The 2025 first quarter operating margin was 18.2% compared with 17.5% for the 2024 first quarter. The increases in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to higher term and spot contract pricing in the inland and coastal markets, partially offset by higher levels of planned coastal shipyards and increased inland delay days in the 2025 first quarter.

Interest expense for the 2025 first quarter decreased 20% compared with the 2024 first quarter, primarily due to a lower average interest rate in the 2025 first quarter, as well as lower debt levels in the 2025 first quarter. There was no capitalized interest excluded from interest expense during the 2025 or 2024 first quarter.

Current assets as of March 31, 2025 increased 3% compared with December 31, 2024. Trade accounts receivable increased 3% primarily due to higher business activity levels in KMT. Inventories – net increased 10% primarily due to the impact of supply delays in KDS resulting in the buildup of inventory for mainly power generation projects that are scheduled to be delivered later in 2025.

Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, at March 31, 2025 increased 3% compared with December 31, 2024. The increase reflected $90.7 million of capital additions (including an increase in accrued capital expenditures of $12.0 million) and a $97.3 million equipment acquisition in the 2025 first quarter, partially offset by $61.6 million of depreciation expense and $0.1 million of property disposals more fully described under Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures below.

Operating lease right-of-use assets as of March 31, 2025 decreased 1% compared with December 31, 2024, primarily due to lease amortization expense, partially offset by new leases acquired in the 2025 first quarter.

Other intangibles, net, as of March 31, 2025 decreased 6% compared with December 31, 2024, due to amortization during the 2025 first quarter.

Other assets as of March 31, 2025 increased 5% compared with December 31, 2024, primarily due to additional deferred major maintenance drydock expenditures incurred during the 2025 first quarter, partially offset by amortization of drydock expenditures.

Current liabilities as of March 31, 2025 decreased 5% compared with December 31, 2024. Income taxes payable decreased 14% primarily due to timing of federal income tax payments. Accounts payable increased 8% primarily due to timing of KDS inventory purchases and KMT shipyard payments. Accrued liabilities decreased 20% primarily from payment during the 2025 first quarter of employee incentive compensation accrued during 2024.

Long-term debt, net – less current portion, as of March 31, 2025 increased 26% compared with December 31, 2024, primarily reflecting increased borrowings under the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility.

Total equity as of March 31, 2025 decreased 1% compared with December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to treasury stock purchases of $101.5 million and tax withholdings of $5.9 million on RSU vestings, partially offset by net earnings attributable to Kirby of $76.0 million, amortization of share-based compensation of $7.8 million, and stock option exercises of $0.3 million.

(a)

Variable interest rate of 5.6% at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

On July 29, 2022, the Company entered into the 2027 Credit Agreement with a group of commercial banks, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the administrative agent bank that allows for a $500 million 2027 Revolving Credit Facility and a $250 million 2027 Term Loan with a maturity date of July 29, 2027. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company repaid $80 million under the 2027 Term Loan prior to scheduled maturities. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $100 million under the 2027 Term Loan prior to scheduled maturities. As a result, no repayments are required until March 31, 2027. Future repayments under the 2027 Term Loan are excluded from short term liabilities because the Company intends to use availability under the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility to repay these amounts upon maturity. Outstanding letters of credit under the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility were $6,000 and available borrowing capacity was $275.0 million as of March 31, 2025.

On February 3, 2022, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement for the 2033 Notes with a group of institutional investors, consisting of $60 million Series A Notes and $240 million Series B Notes, each due January 19, 2033. The Series A Notes were issued on October 20, 2022, and the Series B Notes were issued on January 19, 2023. No principal payments will be required until maturity.

The Company has a $15 million Credit Line with Bank of America for short-term liquidity needs and letters of credit, with a maturity date of June 30, 2026. Outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Line were $6.8 million and available borrowing capacity was $8.2 million as of March 31, 2025.

As of March 31, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under its debt instruments. For additional information about the Company’s debt instruments, see Note 5, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) as well as Note 5, Long-Term Debt, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures

The Company generated positive operating cash flows during the 2025 first quarter with net cash provided by operating activities of $36.5 million compared with $123.3 million for the 2024 first quarter, a 70% decrease. The decline in operating cash flows was mainly due to unfavorable changes in inventories in 2025 due to the impact of supply delays in KDS resulting in the buildup of inventory for mainly power generation projects that are scheduled to be delivered later in 2025, partially offset by higher operating income in KMT. The increase in KMT operating income was driven by higher term and spot contract pricing, partially offset by higher levels of planned coastal shipyards and increased inland delay days in the 2025 first quarter. During the 2025 and 2024 first quarter, the Company generated cash of $0.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, from proceeds from the disposition of assets, and $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, from proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

For the 2025 first quarter, cash generated was used for capital expenditures of $78.7 million, including $64.6 million associated with marine maintenance capital and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facility improvements, as well as $14.1 million for growth spending in both segments. The growth spending is related to inland equipment construction and equipment for use in a variety of KDS markets including electric fracturing equipment, generators, and other related equipment. In addition, the Company used cash of $97.3 million for an equipment acquisition in the 2025 first quarter.

Treasury Stock Purchases

During the 2025 first quarter, the Company purchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock for $101.5 million, at an average price of $101.19 per share. Subsequent to March 31, 2025 and through May 9, 2025, the Company purchased an additional 0.3 million shares of its common stock for $26.9 million, at an average price of $92.14 per share. As of May 9, 2025, the Company had approximately 1.6 million shares available under its existing purchase authorizations. Historically, treasury stock purchases have been financed through operating cash flows and borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility. The Company is authorized to purchase its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange and in privately negotiated transactions. When purchasing its common stock, the Company is subject to price, trading volume, and other market considerations. Shares purchased may be used for reissuance upon the exercise of stock options or the granting of other forms of incentive compensation, in future acquisitions for stock, or for other appropriate corporate purposes. For more information about stock purchases in the 2025 first quarter, see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

Liquidity

Funds generated from operations are available for acquisitions, capital expenditure projects, common stock purchases, repayments of borrowings, and for other corporate and operating requirements. In addition to net cash flows provided by operating activities, as of May 9, 2025 the Company also had cash and cash equivalents of $49.5 million, availability of $220 million under its 2027 Revolving Credit Facility, and $8.2 million available under its Credit Line.

Neither the Company, nor any of its subsidiaries, is obligated on any debt instrument, swap agreement, or any other financial instrument or commercial contract which has a rating trigger, except for the pricing grid on its 2027 Credit Agreement.

The Company expects to continue to fund expenditures for acquisitions, capital construction projects, common stock purchases, repayment of borrowings, and for other operating requirements from a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operating activities, and available financing arrangements.

The 2027 Revolving Credit Facility’s commitment is in the amount of $500 million and matures July 29, 2027. The $500 million 4.2% senior unsecured notes do not mature until March 1, 2028 and require no prepayments. The 2033 Notes do not mature until January 19, 2033 and require no prepayments. The 2027 Term Loan is subject to quarterly installments, beginning March 31, 2027, in increasing percentages of the original principal amount of the loan, with the remaining unpaid balance of approximately $43.8 million payable on July 29, 2027, assuming no prepayments. The 2027 Term Loan is prepayable, in whole or in part, without penalty.

There are numerous factors that may negatively impact the Company’s cash flows in 2025. For a list of significant risks and uncertainties that could impact cash flows, see Note 13, Contingencies and Commitments, of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited), and Item 1A — Risk Factors and Note 14, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Amounts available under the Company’s existing financial arrangements are subject to the Company continuing to meet the covenants of the credit facilities as described in Note 5, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) as well as Note 5, Long-Term Debt, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Company has issued guaranties or obtained standby letters of credit and performance bonds supporting performance by the Company and its subsidiaries of contractual or contingent legal obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate notional value of these instruments is $32.8 million at March 31, 2025, including $11.6 million in letters of credit and $21.1 million in performance bonds. All of these instruments have an expiration date within two years. The Company does not believe demand for payment under these instruments is likely and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments.

KMT term contracts typically contain fuel escalation clauses, or the customer pays for the fuel. However, there is generally a 30 to 120 day delay before contracts are adjusted depending on the specific terms of the contract. In general, the fuel escalation clauses are effective over the long-term in allowing the Company to recover changes in fuel costs due to fuel price changes. However, the short-term effectiveness of the fuel escalation clauses can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, specific terms of the fuel escalation formulas, fuel price volatility, navigating conditions, tow sizes, trip routing, and the location of loading and discharge ports that may result in the Company over or under recovering its fuel costs. The Company’s spot contract rates generally reflect current fuel prices at the time the contract is signed but do not have escalators for fuel.

24

* * *

The Company has certain mechanisms designed to help mitigate the impacts of rising costs. For example, KMT has long-term contracts which generally contain cost escalation clauses whereby certain costs, including fuel as noted above, can be largely passed through to its customers. Spot contract rates include the cost of fuel and are subject to market volatility. In KDS, the cost of major components for large manufacturing orders is secured with suppliers at the time a customer order is finalized, which somewhat limits exposure to inflation. To the extent possible, the Company also seeks to include contractual language to address recovery of increased costs related to tariffs in KDS. The repair portion of KDS is based on prevailing current market rates.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company’s exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2024.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)), as of March 31, 2025, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2025, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
