BWX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 2025 

(UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have presented the condensed consolidated financial statements of BWX Technologies, Inc. ("BWXT" or the "Company") in U.S. dollars in accordance with the interim reporting requirements of Form 10-Q, Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Certain financial information and disclosures normally included in our financial statements prepared annually in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Readers of these financial statements should, therefore, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (our "2024 10-K"). We have included all adjustments, in the opinion of management, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation.

We use the equity method to account for investments in entities that we do not control, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. We generally refer to these entities as "joint ventures." We have eliminated all intercompany transactions and accounts. We classify assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts as current using the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. We have recast certain amounts previously reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows to conform to the presentation at March 31, 2025. We present the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements on the basis of continuing operations, unless otherwise stated.

Unless the context otherwise indicates, "we," "us" and "our" mean BWXT and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Reportable Segments

We operate in two reportable segments: Government Operations and Commercial Operations. Our reportable segments are further described as follows:

•Our Government Operations segment manufactures naval nuclear reactors, including the related nuclear fuel, for the U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program for use in submarines and aircraft carriers. Through this segment, we also fabricate fuel-bearing precision components that range in weight from a few grams to hundreds of tons, manufacture electromechanical equipment, perform design, manufacturing, inspection, assembly and testing activities, downblend Cold War-era government stockpiles of high-enriched uranium and develop and manufacture advanced materials and products for commercial, military and space applications. In addition, we supply proprietary and sole-source valves, manifolds and fittings to global naval and commercial shipping customers. In-house capabilities also include wet chemistry uranium processing, advanced heat treatment to optimize component material properties and a controlled, clean-room environment with the capacity to assemble railcar-size components. This segment also provides various other services, primarily through joint ventures, to the U.S. Government including nuclear materials management and operation, environmental management and administrative and operating services for various U.S. Government-owned facilities. These services are primarily provided to the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE"), including the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science and the Office of Environmental Management, the Department of Defense and NASA. In addition, this segment also develops technology for advanced nuclear reactors for a variety of power and propulsion applications in the space and terrestrial domains and offers complete advanced nuclear fuel and reactor design and engineering, licensing and manufacturing services for these programs.

•Our Commercial Operations segment fabricates commercial nuclear steam generators, nuclear fuel, fuel handling systems, pressure vessels, reactor components, heat exchangers, tooling delivery systems and other auxiliary equipment, including containers for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level waste, and supplies nuclear-grade materials and precisely machined components for nuclear utility customers. We have supplied the nuclear industry with more than 1,300 large, heavy components worldwide and are the only commercial heavy nuclear component manufacturer in North America. This segment also provides specialized engineering services that include structural component design, 3-D thermal-hydraulic engineering analysis, weld and robotic process development, electrical and controls engineering and metallurgy and materials engineering. In addition, this segment offers in-plant inspection, maintenance and modification services for nuclear steam generators, heat exchangers, reactors, fuel handling systems and balance of plant equipment, as well as specialized non-destructive examination and tooling/repair solutions. This segment also manufactures medical radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals and medical devices, and partners with life science and pharmaceutical companies developing new drugs.

See Note 8 and Note 3 for financial information about our segments. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2025. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 2024 10-K.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

There were no accounting standards adopted during the three months ended March 31, 2025 that had a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

Contracts and Revenue Recognition

We generally recognize contract revenues and related costs over time for individual performance obligations based on a cost-to-cost method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Topic Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We recognize estimated contract revenue and resulting income based on the measurement of the extent of progress toward completion as a percentage of the total project. Certain costs may be excluded from the cost-to-cost method of measuring progress, such as significant costs for uninstalled materials, if such costs do not depict our performance in transferring control of goods or services to the customer. We review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in income in the period when those estimates are revised. We recognize revenue on certain cost plus and time and materials contracts equal to the amount we have the right to invoice the customer when performance obligations are satisfied over time and the invoice amount corresponds directly with the value we are providing the customer. Certain of our contracts recognize revenue at a point in time, and revenue on these contracts is recognized when control transfers to the customer. The majority of our revenue that is recognized at a point in time is related to parts and certain medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals in our Commercial Operations segment. For all contracts, if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined.

See Note 3 for a further discussion of revenue recognition.

Provision for Income Taxes

We are subject to federal income tax in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., as well as income tax within multiple U.S. state jurisdictions. We provide for income taxes based on the enacted tax laws and rates in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. These jurisdictions may have regimes of taxation that vary with respect to nominal rates and with respect to the basis on which these rates are applied. This variation, along with changes in our mix of income within these jurisdictions, can contribute to shifts in our effective tax rate from period to period.

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was 17.7% as compared to 22.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21% primarily due to excess tax benefits associated with equity compensation. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was higher than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes within the U.S. and the unfavorable rate differential associated with our foreign earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

At March 31, 2025, we had restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $6.5 million, $3.7 million of which was held for future decommissioning of facilities (which is included in Other Assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets) and $2.8 million of which was held to meet reinsurance reserve requirements of our captive insurer.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Our operations give rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange ("FX") rates. We use derivative financial instruments, primarily FX forward contracts, to reduce the impact of changes in FX rates on our operating results. We use these instruments to hedge our exposure associated with revenues or costs on our long-term contracts and other transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our operating entities' functional currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.

We enter into derivative financial instruments primarily as hedges of certain firm purchase and sale commitments and loans between domestic and foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies. We record these contracts at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Based on the hedge designation at the inception of the contract, the related gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders' equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument not designated as a hedging instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that require immediate recognition are included as a component of Other – net on our condensed consolidated statements of income and are recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature and use of the instruments.

We have designated the majority of our FX forward contracts that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges. The hedged risk is the risk of changes in functional-currency-equivalent cash flows attributable to changes in FX spot rates of forecasted transactions primarily related to long-term contracts. We exclude from our assessment of effectiveness the portion of the fair value of the FX forward contracts attributable to the difference between FX spot rates and FX forward rates. At March 31, 2025, we had deferred approximately $1.0 million of net gains on these derivative financial instruments. Assuming market conditions continue, we expect to recognize the majority of this amount in the next 12 months. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we recognized gains of $1.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, in Other – net on our condensed consolidated statements of income associated with FX forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments.

At March 31, 2025, our derivative financial instruments consisted of FX forward contracts with a total notional value of $388.3 million with maturities extending to July 2026. These instruments consist primarily of FX forward contracts to purchase or sell Canadian dollars and Euros. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. We attempt to mitigate this risk by using major financial institutions with high credit ratings. Our counterparties to derivative financial instruments have the benefit of the same collateral arrangements and covenants as described under our credit facility.

New Accounting and Disclosure Standards

In December 2023, the FASB issued updates to Topic Income Taxes to provide, on an annual basis, disaggregated

Table of Contents

disclosures with respect to the reconciliation of our effective tax rate, as well as a disaggregation of income taxes paid, net of

refunds received. The new standard is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard and expect that it will only require changes to our disclosures with no impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

  

In November 2024, the FASB issued updates to Topic Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures: Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. These updates require a public entity to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements on an annual and interim basis. The updates are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. A public entity may apply these amendments on a prospective basis or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard and expect that it will only require changes to our disclosures with no impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Performance Obligations

As we progress on our contracts and the underlying performance obligations for which we recognize revenue over time, we refine our estimates of variable consideration and total estimated costs at completion, which impact the overall profitability on our contracts and performance obligations. Changes in these estimates result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments that impact our revenues and/or costs of contracts. The aggregate impact of changes in estimates decreased our revenues and operating income as follows:

Contract Assets and Liabilities

We include revenues and related costs incurred, plus accumulated contract costs that exceed amounts invoiced to customers under the terms of the contracts, in Contracts in progress. Costs specific to certain contracts for which we recognize revenue at a point in time are also included in Contracts in progress. We include in Advance billings on contracts billings that exceed accumulated contract costs and revenues recognized over time. Amounts that are withheld on our fixed-price incentive fee contracts are classified within Retainages. Certain of these amounts require conditions other than the passage of time to be achieved, with the remaining amounts only requiring the passage of time. Most long-term contracts contain provisions for progress payments. Our unbilled receivables do not contain an allowance for credit losses as we expect to invoice customers and collect all amounts for unbilled receivables. Changes in Contracts in progress and Advance billings on contracts are primarily driven by differences in the timing of revenue recognition and billings to our customers. Our fixed-price incentive fee contracts for our Government Operations segment include provisions that result in an increase in retainages on contracts during the first and third quarters of the year, with larger payments received during the second and fourth quarters. Retainages also vary as a result of timing differences between incurring costs and achieving milestones that allow us to recover these amounts.

Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations represent the dollar amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the future from performance obligations on contracts previously awarded and in progress. At March 31, 2025, our remaining performance obligations were $4,878.7 million. We expect to recognize approximately 61% of the revenue associated with our remaining performance obligations by the end of 2026, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter.

NOTE 4 – PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

We record the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost within Operating income on our condensed consolidated statements of income. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, these amounts were $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are included in Other – net within the condensed consolidated statements of income. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, these amounts were $(1.7) million and $(3.0) million, respectively. Components of net periodic benefit cost included in net income were as follows:

Derivatives

Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities currently consist of FX forward contracts. Where applicable, the value of these derivative assets and liabilities is computed by discounting the projected future cash flow amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including FX forward and spot rates, interest rates and counterparty performance risk adjustments. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had FX forward contracts outstanding to purchase or sell foreign currencies, primarily Canadian dollars and Euros, with a total fair value of $2.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively. Derivative assets and liabilities are included in Accounts receivable – other and Accounts payable, respectively, on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Other Financial Instruments

We used the following methods and assumptions in estimating our fair value disclosures for our other financial instruments, as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts that we have reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets for Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to their highly liquid nature.

Long-term and short-term debt. We base the fair values of debt instruments, including our 4.125% senior notes due 2028 (the "Senior Notes due 2028") and our 4.125% senior notes due 2029 (the "Senior Notes due 2029"), on quoted market prices. Where quoted prices are not available, we base the fair values on the present value of future cash flows discounted at estimated borrowing rates for similar debt instruments or on estimated prices based on current yields for debt issues of similar quality and terms. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Senior Notes due 2028 was $377.7 million and $374.6 million, respectively, and the fair value of the Senior Notes due 2029 was $372.8 million and $371.9 million, respectively. The fair value of our remaining debt instruments approximated their carrying values at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

Note receivable. Included in Other current assets is a note receivable related to a third-party loan. We base the fair value of this level 2 note receivable instrument on the present value of future cash flows discounted at market interest rates for financial instruments with similar quality and terms. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our note receivable was $6.4 million and $$6.5 million, respectively, and approximated its fair value.

NOTE 7 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock-based compensation recognized for all of our plans for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 totaled $5.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively, with associated tax benefit totaling $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

Information about our Major Customers:

In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, sales to the U.S. Government accounted for approximately 92% and 93% of our Government Operations segment revenues, respectively. In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, sales to large utility customers accounted for approximately 73% and 76% of our Commercial Operations segment revenues, respectively.

Evaluation of segment performance:

Our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") measures the performance of each segment based on several metrics, including revenue and operating income and uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of and to allocate resources to each segment. Our CODM does not use assets by segment to evaluate segment performance or allocate resources. Consequently, we do not disclose assets by segment.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 in Part I of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q ("Report"), as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (our "2024 10-K").

In this Report, unless the context otherwise indicates, "we," "us" and "our" mean BWX Technologies, Inc. ("BWXT" or the "Company") and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our Company. Forward-looking statements include those statements that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Statements and assumptions regarding expectations and projections of specific projects, our future backlog, revenues, income, capital spending, strategic investments, acquisitions or divestitures, return of capital activities or margin improvement initiatives are examples of forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "seek," "goal," "could," "intend," "may," "should" or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In addition, sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement.

We have based our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us and our current expectations, estimates and projections about our Company, industries and business environment. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and you should not rely unduly on them as they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. While our management considers these statements and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to numerous factors, including potentially the risk factors described in Item 1A of our 2024 10-K, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. As a contractor to the U.S. Government, such risks include, without limitation, budget uncertainty, the risk of future budget cuts, the impact of continuing resolution funding mechanisms and the debt ceiling, the potential for government shutdowns and changing funding and acquisition priorities. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in our forward-looking statements.

We have discussed many of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this Report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this Report or in our 2024 10-K could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update or review any forward-looking statement or our description of important factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable laws.

General

We operate in two reportable segments: Government Operations and Commercial Operations. In general, we operate in capital-intensive industries and rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of our revenues. We are currently exploring growth strategies across our segments to expand and complement our existing businesses. We would expect to fund these opportunities with cash generated from operations or by raising additional capital through debt, equity or some combination thereof.

Government Operations

The revenues of our Government Operations segment are largely a function of defense spending by the U.S. Government. Through this segment, we engineer, design and manufacture precision naval nuclear components, reactors and nuclear fuel for the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE")/National Nuclear Safety Administration's Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. In addition, this segment downblends Cold War-era government stockpiles of high-enriched uranium, develop and manufacture advanced materials and products for commercial, military and space applications and supply proprietary and sole-source valves, manifolds and fittings to global naval and commercial shipping customers. As a supplier of major nuclear components for certain U.S. Government programs, this segment is a significant participant in the defense industry.

Table of Contents

This segment also provides various services to the U.S. Government by managing and operating high-consequence operations at U.S. nuclear weapons sites, national laboratories and manufacturing complexes. The revenues and equity income of investees under these types of contracts are largely a function of spending by the U.S. Government and the performance scores we and our consortium partners earn in managing and operating these sites. With our specialized capabilities of full life-cycle management of special materials, facilities and technologies, we believe this segment is well-positioned to continue participating in the ongoing cleanup, operation and management of critical government-owned nuclear sites, laboratories and manufacturing complexes maintained by the DOE, NASA and other federal agencies.

Additionally, this segment also develops technology for a variety of applications, including advanced nuclear power sources, and offers complete advanced nuclear fuel and reactor design and engineering, licensing and manufacturing services for new advanced nuclear reactors.

Commercial Operations

Through this segment, we design and manufacture commercial nuclear steam generators, heat exchangers, pressure vessels, reactor components, as well as other auxiliary equipment, including containers for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level nuclear waste. This segment is a leading supplier of nuclear fuel, fuel handling systems, tooling delivery systems, nuclear-grade materials and precisely machined components, and related services for CANDU nuclear power plants. This segment also provides a variety of engineering and in-plant services and is a significant supplier to nuclear power utilities undergoing major refurbishment and plant life extension projects. Additionally, this segment is a global manufacturer and supplier of critical medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals.

Our Commercial Operations segment's overall activity primarily depends on the demand and competitiveness of nuclear energy and the demand for critical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals. A significant portion of our Commercial Operations segment's operations depends on the timing of maintenance outages, the cyclical nature of capital expenditures and major refurbishment and life extension projects, as well as the demand for nuclear fuel and fuel handling equipment primarily in the Canadian market, which could cause variability in our financial results.

Acquisitions

Aerojet Ordnance Tennessee, Inc.

On January 3, 2025, we completed the acquisition of Aerojet Ordnance Tennessee, Inc. ("A.O.T."), a subsidiary of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. A.O.T. is a leading provider of advanced special materials which will further enhance our capabilities to develop and manufacture advanced materials and products for commercial, military and space applications. A.O.T. is reported as part of our Government Operations segment.

Kinectrics Inc.

On December 27, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Kinectrics Holdings Inc., the parent company of Kinectrics Inc. ("Kinectrics"). Kinectrics is a leader in providing lifecycle management services for the global nuclear power and transmission and distribution markets, and in the production and supply of isotopes for the radiopharmaceutical industry. Kinectrics employs over 1,300 employees located across 20 sites worldwide. This acquisition is targeted to close in the middle of 2025, following necessary regulatory and other approvals. Once completed, Kinectrics will be reported as part of our Commercial Operations segment.

See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information about our recent acquisition activity.

Critical Accounting Estimates

For a summary of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, see Item 7 of our 2024 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2025.

Contracts & Revenue Recognition

We generally recognize contract revenue and resulting income over time based on the measurement of the extent of progress toward completion using total costs incurred as a percentage of the total estimated project costs for individual

Table of Contents

performance obligations. We review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in income in the period when those estimates are revised. If a current estimate of total contract costs indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined. 

As we progress on our contracts and the underlying performance obligations, we refine our estimates of variable consideration and total estimated costs at completion, which impact the overall profitability on our contracts and performance obligations. Changes in these estimates result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments that impact our revenues and/or costs of contracts. The aggregate impact of changes in estimates decreased our revenues and operating income as follows:

(1)During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, no adjustments to any one contract had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Contracts may be modified at the request of our customer or initiated by us to amend all or part of an existing contract, including contract type. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Modifications to our contracts are generally accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract as these modifications are not distinct from the existing contract and accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. 2024

Revenues increased $68.2 million, or 14.0%, to $555.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $487.1 million for the corresponding period of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of long-lead material procurements of $62.5 million and the acquisition of A.O.T. during the quarter ended March 31, 2025 which increased revenues by $6.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues associated with our advanced technologies business.

Operating income increased $12.1 million to $97.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $85.7 million for the corresponding period of 2024, primarily driven by the operating income impact of the changes in revenues noted above.

Three months ended March 31, 2025 vs. 2024

Revenues increased 9.6%, or $11.3 million, to $128.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $117.0 million for the corresponding period of 2024. The increase was primarily related to higher revenues in nuclear components manufacturing of $26.3 million which was partially offset by a $16.2 million decrease in revenues related to on-site inspection, maintenance and refurbishment work when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

Operating income decreased $2.1 million to $6.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $8.6 million for the corresponding period of 2024. The decrease was primarily related to an unfavorable shift in our product mix as well as a $2.6 million increase in expenses associated with merger and acquisition and restructuring-related activities when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year.

Unallocated Corporate

Unallocated corporate expenses increased $6.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period of 2024. The increase was due to higher healthcare costs of $3.2 million related to the timing of claims in addition to an increase in legal and consulting costs associated with merger and acquisition related activities of $1.9 million when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. We also experienced a $0.9 million increase in expenditures related to the transformation of our information technology infrastructure.

We primarily operate in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. and we recognize our U.S. income tax provision based on the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, our Canadian tax provision based on the Canadian local statutory rate of approximately 25%, and our U.K. tax provision based on the U.K. local statutory rate of 25%.

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was 17.7% as compared to 22.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21% primarily due to excess tax benefits associated with equity compensation partially offset by the unfavorable foreign rate differential. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was higher than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes within the U.S. and the unfavorable rate differential associated with our foreign earnings and lower levels of excess tax benefits associated with equity compensation.

Backlog

Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress. Not all of our expected revenue from a contract award is recorded in backlog for a variety of reasons, including that some projects are awarded and completed within the same reporting period.

Our backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts that meet the criteria in Financial Accounting Standards Board Topic Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as discussed in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. It is possible that our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies.

We are subject to the budgetary and appropriations cycle of the U.S. Government as it relates to our Government Operations segment. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers.

We do not include the value of our unconsolidated joint venture contracts in backlog. These unconsolidated joint ventures are included in our Government Operations segment.

As of March 31, 2025, our ending backlog was $4,878.7 million, which included $396.3 million of unfunded backlog related to U.S. Government contracts. We expect to recognize approximately 61% of the revenue associated with our backlog by the end of 2026, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter.

Major new awards from the U.S. Government are typically received following Congressional approval of the budget for the U.S. Government's next fiscal year, which starts October 1, and may not be awarded to us before the end of the calendar year. Due to the fact that most contracts awarded by the U.S. Government are subject to these annual funding approvals, the total values of the underlying programs are significantly larger.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Credit Facility

On October 12, 2022, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Facility consists of a $750 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a $250 million senior secured term A loan (the "Term Loan"). The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan are scheduled to mature on October 12, 2027. The proceeds of loans under the Credit Facility are available for working capital needs, permitted acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.

The Credit Facility allows for additional parties to become lenders and, subject to certain conditions, for the increase of the commitments under the Credit Facility, subject to an aggregate maximum for all additional commitments of (1) the greater of (a) $400 million and (b) 100% of EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Facility, for the last four full fiscal quarters, plus (2) all voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan, plus (3) additional amounts provided the Company is in compliance with a pro forma first lien net leverage ratio test of less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00.

The Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company's present and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries. The Credit Facility is secured by first-priority liens on certain assets owned by the Company and its subsidiary guarantors (other than its subsidiaries comprising a portion of its Government Operations segment).

The Credit Facility requires interest payments on outstanding loans on a periodic basis until maturity. We are required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loan in an amount equal to 1.25% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan on the last business day of each quarter, with the balance of the Term Loan due at maturity. We may prepay all loans under the Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary Term SOFR breakage costs), subject to notice requirements.

The Credit Facility includes financial covenants that are evaluated on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The maximum permitted total net leverage ratio is 4.00 to 1.00, which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 for up to four consecutive fiscal quarters after a material acquisition. The minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio is 3.00 to 1.00. In addition, the Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants, including with respect to debt, liens, investments, mergers, acquisitions, dividends, equity repurchases and asset sales. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the Credit Facility.

Outstanding loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either (1) the Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus a margin ranging from 1.0% to 1.75% per year or (2) the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.75% per year. We are charged a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, and that fee ranges from 0.15% to 0.225% per year. Additionally, we are charged a letter of credit fee of between 1.0% and 1.75% per year with respect to the amount of each financial letter of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility, and a letter of credit fee of between 0.75% and 1.05% per year with respect to the amount of each performance letter of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin for loans, the commitment fee and the letter of credit fees set forth above will vary quarterly based on our total net leverage ratio. Based on the total net leverage ratio applicable at March 31, 2025, the margin for Term SOFR and base rate loans was 1.25% and 0.25%, respectively, the letter of credit fee for financial letters of credit and performance letters of credit was 1.25% and 0.825%, respectively, and the commitment fee for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility was 0.175%.

As of March 31, 2025, borrowings under the Term Loan totaled $234.4, borrowings and letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility totaled $170.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, and we had $578.6 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility for borrowings and to meet letter of credit requirements. As of March 31, 2025, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 5.67%.

The Credit Facility generally includes customary events of default for a secured credit facility. Under the Credit Facility, (1) if an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events occurs with respect to the Company, all related obligations will immediately become due and payable; (2) if any other event of default exists, the lenders will be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the related obligations outstanding; and (3) if any event of default exists, the lenders will be permitted to terminate their commitments thereunder and exercise other rights and remedies, including the commencement of foreclosure or other actions against the collateral.

If any default occurs under the Credit Facility, or if we are unable to make any of the representations and warranties in the Credit Facility, we will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.

Senior Notes due 2028

We issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2028 (the "Senior Notes due 2028") pursuant to an indenture dated June 12, 2020 (the "2020 Indenture"), among the Company, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (formerly known as U.S. Bank National Association) ("U.S. Bank"), as trustee. The Senior Notes due 2028 are guaranteed by each of the Company's present and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the Credit Facility.

Interest on the Senior Notes due 2028 is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year at a rate of 4.125% per annum. The Senior Notes due 2028 will mature on June 30, 2028.

We may redeem the Senior Notes due 2028, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to (i) 101.031% of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs during the 12-month period beginning on June 30, 2024 and (ii) 100.0% of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs on or after June 30, 2025, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 

The 2020 Indenture contains customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, failure to comply with covenants or agreements contained in the 2020 Indenture or the Senior Notes due 2028 and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events. The 2020 Indenture also contains customary negative covenants. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the 2020 Indenture and the Senior Notes due 2028.

Senior Notes due 2029

We issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2029 (the "Senior Notes due 2029") pursuant to an indenture dated April 13, 2021 (the "2021 Indenture"), among the Company, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank, as trustee. The Senior Notes due 2029 are guaranteed by each of the Company's present and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the Credit Facility.

Interest on the Senior Notes due 2029 is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, at a rate of 4.125% per annum. The Senior Notes due 2029 will mature on April 15, 2029.

We may redeem the Senior Notes due 2029, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to (i) 101.031% of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs during the 12-month period beginning on April 15, 2025 and (ii) 100.0% of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs on or after April 15, 2026, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The 2021 Indenture contains customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, failure to comply with covenants or agreements contained in the 2021 Indenture or the Senior Notes due 2029 and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events. The 2021 Indenture also contains customary negative covenants. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the 2021 Indenture and the Senior Notes due 2029.

Other Arrangements

We have posted surety bonds to support regulatory and contractual obligations for certain decommissioning responsibilities, projects and legal matters. We utilize surety bond facilities to support such obligations, but the issuance of surety bonds under those facilities is typically at the surety's discretion, and the surety bond facilities generally permit the surety, in its sole discretion, to terminate the facility or demand collateral. Although there can be no assurance that we will maintain our surety bond capacity, we believe our current capacity is adequate to support our existing requirements for the next 12 months. In addition, these surety bonds generally indemnify the beneficiaries should we fail to perform our obligations under the applicable agreements. We, and certain of our subsidiaries, have jointly executed general agreements of indemnity in favor of surety underwriters relating to surety bonds those underwriters issue. As of March 31, 2025, surety bonds issued and outstanding under these arrangements totaled approximately $304.5 million.

Similarly, we have provided letters of credit and bank guarantees to governmental agencies and contractual counterparties to support regulatory and contractual obligations for certain decommissioning responsibilities, projects and legal matters. We utilize our Revolving Credit Facility and a bilateral letter of credit facility to support such obligations, but the issuance of letters

of credit and bank guarantees under our bilateral letter of credit facility is at the issuer’s discretion, and our bilateral letter of credit facility generally permits the issuer, in its sole discretion, to demand collateral if the issuer does not otherwise have the benefit of the collateral under our Credit Facility. Although there can be no assurance that we will maintain our bilateral letter of credit facility capacity, we believe our current capacity, together with capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, is adequate to support our existing requirements for the next 12 months. As of March 31, 2025, letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding under our bilateral letter of credit facility totaled approximately $28.0 million, and such letters of credit and bank guarantees are secured by the collateral under our Credit Facility.

Long-term Benefit Obligations

As of March 31, 2025, we had underfunded defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans with obligations totaling approximately $99.0 million. These long-term liabilities are expected to require use of our resources to satisfy future funding obligations. Based largely on statutory funding requirements, we expect to make contributions of approximately $8.8 million for the remainder of 2025 related to our pension and postretirement plans. We may also make additional contributions based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, tax planning, evaluation of funded status and risk mitigation strategies.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Investments

Our domestic and foreign cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 were as follows:

Foreign     13,276                                    21,585     
Total       $               70,465                            $  91,180    

  

Our working capital increased by $36.0 million to $491.8 million at March 31, 2025 from $455.8 million at December 31, 2024, primarily due to net changes in contracts in progress and advance billings on contracts due to the timing of project cash flows and a decrease in current liabilities associated with the payment of accrued incentives.

Our net cash provided by operating activities increased by $17.6 million to $50.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $33.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the timing of project cash flows.

Our net cash used in investing activities increased by $126.0 million to $156.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to cash used in investing activities $30.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the $103.3 million acquisition of A.O.T. and $26.4 million investments in equity method investees.

Our net cash provided by financing activities increased by $116.9 million to $84.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to cash used in financing activities of $32.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in net borrowings of long-term debt of $123.4 million which was partially offset by a $10.0 million increase in repurchases of common stock when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year.

At March 31, 2025, we had restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $6.5 million, $3.7 million of which was held for future decommissioning of facilities (which is included in Other Assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets) and $2.8 million of which was held to meet reinsurance reserve requirements of our captive insurer.

At March 31, 2025, we had long-term investments with a fair value of $8.5 million and our investment portfolio consisted entirely of mutual funds. These equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings.

Cash Requirements

As discussed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, on December 27, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Kinectrics for approximately CAD 782.7 million, including the assumption of Kinectrics' net pension and debt liabilities, and estimated transaction expenses. This acquisition is expected to close in the middle of 2025.

We believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, along with cash generated from operations and continued access to capital markets, to satisfy our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.

As of the end of the period covered by this Report, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Exchange Act). This evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Our disclosure controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based on the evaluation referred to above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of March 31, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
